= 虚拟语气

== 介绍

=== 如何彻底掌握虚拟语气
- 理解虚拟语气的本质：为什么虚拟？能不能不虚拟？虚拟 or 不虚拟，意思有何区别？
- 对虚拟语气的语法规则必须烂熟于心(口语比书面语更为常见)
- 真实条件句 VS 非真实条件句，要认真对比
- 记住：虚拟语气都有言外之意
  - If I can help you, I will definitely do so.
  - If I could help you, I would definitely do so.(帮不上)
- 把本课程的讲义烂熟于心，你就啥都明白了

=== 语法规则

== 狗血的故事

- 男一：Michael，酒吧舞大学大四学生，身高 185 cm，人长得贼帅，但家境贫寒。
- 女一：Sally，酒吧舞大学大四学生，家境同样贫寒，跟 Michael 是同班同学，俩人是恋人关系。
- 女二：Susan，酒吧舞大学大四学生，白富美，是 Michael 和 Sally 的同班同学，已经喜欢 Michael 四年了。
- 男二：Jimmy，酒吧舞大学大四学生，高帅富，和上述三位是同班同学，已经当 Sally 的舔狗四年了。

== 针对过去、现在、将来的虚拟【表示假设】
明天就是酒吧舞大学的招聘会了，很多大企业都会来招聘。傍晚的时候，Michael 和 Sally 在校园漫步…

- Sally: “ Jobs are so hard to come by these days. _If I can't find one and don't have any income, will you still love me?_”
#tip("Tip")[
    If I *couldn't* find one and *didn't* have any income, *would* you still love me?
    这样改成虚拟就说明很容易找到工作。
]
- Michael: “ Of course! Don't worry, babe. I've always had good grades. I'm sure some big company will *snatch me up* tomorrow! ”
- Sally: “ _And how will that help? We still can't afford a house._ The prices are ridiculous. ”
- Michael: “Housing prices have crashed in many cities, and Evergrande is down. *_If we could wait, we’d be able to buy a house for peanuts soon._* ”(等不起)
- Sally: “ Tomorrow is the job fair. Any companies you've got your eye on?”
- Michael: “ *_If Apple wanted me, I would consider it._* ”(苹果公司不太可能要他)
- Sally: “ You‘re just boasting. ”
- Michael: “ Just kidding! _But if Tancent offers me a job, I might just take it._ ”(Tancent很可能要，但是Michael不太想去)

#tip("Tip")[
    过去式的情态动词本质上就是虚拟语气，例如Could you help me? could可能性更小，所以表达起来更加委婉。
]

#example("Example")[
Sally: 
- “ If I *can‘t* find one and don’t have any income, will you still love me? ”
- “ If I *couldn’t* find one and didn’t have any income, would you still love me? ”
- “ If I *shouldn’t* find one and didn’t have any income, could you still love me? ”
- “ If I *were not to* find one and didn’t have any income, might you still love me? ”
- “ If I *didn’t* find one and didn’t have any income, should you still love me? ”

区别：情态动词本身含义的区别就是句子含义的区别。
]

#example("Example")[
Michael: 
- “ If we could wait, we’d be able to buy a house for peanuts soon. ”
- “ If we can wait, we’ll be able to buy a house for peanuts soon.”
- “ If we should wait, we might be able to buy a house for peanuts soon.”
- “ If we were to wait, we should be able to buy a house for peanuts soon.”
- “ If we waited, we’d be able to buy a house for peanuts soon.”
]

#example("Example")[
Michael: 
- “ If Apple wanted me, I would consider it.”
- “ But if Tancent offers me a job, I might just take it. ”

辨析：
- “ But if Tancent offers me a job, I might just take it. ”（ Tancent 大概率会给我offer，但我不太想去。）
- “ But if Tancent offers me a job, I may just take it. ”（ Tancent 大概率会给我offer，我也有点想去。）
- “ But if Tancent offered me a job, I might just take it. ”（ Tancent 大概率压根就不会给我offer…）

第二天，Michael 和 Sally 都参加了学校的招聘会，傍晚的时候，两人又在校园里散步…

- Sally: “ Which companies did you apply to? ”
- Michael: “ Quite a few. I also dropped my resume at Apple, but I'm not *holding my breath*. ”

这时，Michael 的手机响了，他接起电话，片刻后，他的表情变得十分惊讶。

- Michael: “ The HR department at Apple called. They've hired me! I start tomorrow, and they've offered me a senior manager position, with a million-dollar salary! ”
- Sally: “ What?! A million bucks? _We can buy a house right away!_ ”
- Michael: “ Yeah, it's unbelievable. But a million only covers the down payment. *_If we had five million, we could buy a house outright. Then, you wouldn't have to work. I'd take care of you._* ”
- Sally: “ I'm capable of working, thank you very much. I don't even dare to dream of a company like Apple. *_If Tancent would hire me, I'd be over the moon._* ”

#example("Example")[
Sally:
- “We can buy a house right away! ”

第二天，Michael 来 Apple 公司报道，意外地发现他居然有一间独立的办公室，他居然刚入职就成了一个百人项目的负责人，最离谱的是，公司居然给 他配了一个女秘书，这个女秘书还不是别人，正是他的同班同学 Susan！看着一身OL制服的 Susan 帮自己冲咖啡，直接给 Michael 整不会了…

- Susan: “ Why are you looking so *glum*? Am I not doing well as your secretary? ”
- Michael: “ Turns out Apple is your family's business. I knew you were well-off, but I never imagined your dad was the richest guy in the country. ”
- Susan: “ What's the point of being the wealthiest if you still don't like me? ”
- Michael: “ *Forced love never works out.* ”
- Susan: “ *_It might work out if you gave it a try._* ”(有点委屈，不管Susan怎么做，Michael还是不喜欢她)
- Michael: “ Don't do this, Susan. I never imagined it would be like this. *_If I had known Apple was your family's company, if I had known you were behind all this, I wouldn't have taken this job in the first place._* I'm going to HR to resign. ”(过去的虚拟)
- Susan: “ So just because my family has money, you don't like me? *_If my dad was a regular farmer like Sally's, would you fancy me?_* ”
- Michael: “ *_Even if Apple wasn't in the mix, I still wouldn't be into you, Susan._* We're just not meant to be. ”

#tip("Tip")[
    口语里面都使用was，书面语必须用were。

听到 Michael 绝情的话语，Susan 泫然欲泣，这个时候，Michael 的电话响了，Michael 一看是自己老爸打来的，于是接起了电话…

- Michael‘s dad: “ Son, your mom got into a car accident and she's in the ICU. It's costing us a hundred grand a day. I've already sold the house, but we can only keep going for a week. Son, _if we don’t come up with the damn money, your mom won’t make it!_ ”
- Michael: “ Dad, don't worry. I'll figure it out. ”

Susan 走过来，抓住 Michael 的手，另外一只手掏出一张银行卡放在 Michael 的手里。

- Susan: “ There's a billion in the account, it's what my dad set aside for my wedding. Take it for now, the password is your birthday. ”
- Michael: “ Susan, I... ” (Michael 第一次发现 Susan 竟然如此美丽…)
- Susan: “ Just take it! I know you don't love me, you love Sally. I know _even with this billion, you still won't love me_, but Auntie's illness is urgent! ”(语气更委屈)

Michael 张了张嘴，却什么都说不出口，他想把手里的银行卡还给 Susan，但这张密码设置成了自己生日的银行卡此刻重若千钧...

Michael 心系母亲的安危，只好开着 Susan 的布加迪赶往医院，Michael 在医院交了五百万住院费之后，母亲的病情马上就稳定 下来了。在医院忙活了两天之后，Michael 开着布加迪回了学校，校园里此时下起了雨…

- Sally: “ Where did you get this car? ”
- Michael: “ It's from work. ”
- Sally: “ Does the company really provide employees with such outrageous sports cars? ”
- Michael: “ Yeah, our company's got great *perks*. ”
- Sally: “ You're lying! This is Susan's car! *_If you loved me, you wouldn’t have lied to me._* Are you planning to dump me and marry Susan, huh? ”(从句现在，主句过去)
- Michael: “ Enough! *_Even if I had told you the truth, would you believe me? If I had known you were this kind of woman, I..._* ”(从句过去，主句将来)
- Sally: “ You! *_Had I known you were like this, I would have taken Tancent's offer today._* I only turned it down because Tancent is Jimmy's family business.”
- Michael: “ Oh, so you've found someone else during all this? I must be blind! ”
- Sally: (Tears in eyes) “ Michael, you jerk! You'll regret this! ”

看着 Sally 在雨中跑远，Michael 心痛万分，他想追上去留住 Sally，但身边的布加迪却像磁石一样让他动弹不得，Michael 仰天长啸，然后 duang 地一声把拳头砸在了布加迪的引擎盖上。

傍晚八点，Susan 和 Jimmy 在一家顶级餐厅共进晚餐。

- Susan: “ Things went well, but we didn't leave any loose ends, right? ”
- Jimmy: “ Don't worry, I gave that hit-and-run driver five million as hush money. *_If he dared to rat me out, I'll make him disappear!_* ”(他不太可能把Jimmy供出来，但是如果供出来了，Jimmy会让他消失)
- Susan: “ Good. I'll transfer the five million to you later. ”
- Jimmy: “ No need. This isn't all for you anyway. *_Hadn’t we orchestrated this little drama, there wouldn’t be any chance for Sally to fall into my lap._* ”
- Susan: “ I still don't get what you see in her. Sure, she's pretty, but there are plenty of pretty girls out there. What's so special about her? ”
- Jimmy: “ Because Sally always makes me ponder one thing: *_If my family wasn't so loaded, could I still have a chance with her?_* ”
- Susan: “ Oh, spare me! So mawkish! ”
- Jimmy: “ You have the nerve to say that to me? I gave you advice long ago. *_I should've sealed the deal with Michael from the get-go if I were you. If you two had gotten together earlier, I would've had Sally wrapped around my finger ages ago, believe me._* ”
- Susan: “ Spare me! If Michael was so easy to hook, I wouldn't have liked him either. You're no different. *_If Sally was the type to fall for you at the snap of your fingers, would you still be hung up on her?_* ”
- Jimmy: “ Fair point. ”

FIVE YEARS LATER…
五年后，Michael 已经成了 Apple 公司的 CEO，他和 Susan 的婚姻还算美满，只不过，这么多年了，俩人却没生下个一男半女。Michael 十分渴望拥有自己 的孩子，于是经常去幼儿园周围“云”别人家的孩子，这一天，Michael 恰巧遇到了 Sally 来接自己的儿子 Max，见到 Max 的那一刻，Michael 立马就傻了…

- Michael: (pointing to Max) “ Sal, he… ”
- Sally: “ He what? Max, my son! ”
- Michael: “ His dad is Jimmy? ”
- Sally: “ Of course! *_If it wasn’t Jimmy, could it be you?_* ”
- Michael: “ I don't believe it! This must be my son! He looks so much like me! ”
- Sally: “ Lots of people look alike! *If he was your son*, how come he's five years old and hasn't seen you as a dad? ”
- Michael: “ Now today he’s seeing me! Son, come here to Dad! ”
- Max: “ Mom, I'm scared. This weirdo is so scary. ”
- Sally: “ Don't be scared, son. This uncle became like this by accident. *Hadn’t it been for a seductive woman and a Bugatti, he wouldn't be like this today.* ”
- Max: “ Mom, what's a Bugatti? ”
- Sally: “ It's a very, very expensive car.”
- Max: “ Can I drive a Bugatti when I grow up? ”
- Sally: “ _If you earn the money yourself, you can buy any expensive car you want._ *But if it was given by some seductive woman, you absolutely should not accept it. Got it?* ”
- Max: “ Got it! ”

翌日，某顶级私人医院亲子鉴定中心。Michael、Sally、Susan，还有 Jimmy，四个人一言不发地盯着桌子上的鉴定报告，这时，Susan 突然起身，抓起报告单撕成两半，狠狠摔在Michael的脸上，然后夺门而出，Jimmy 深深看了一眼 Sally，冷笑一声，随后拂袖而去。

- Susan: “ *_If I had known it would turn out like this..._* ”
- Jimmy: “ Damn it! *_If I had known earlier, I wouldn’t have been raising his son for five years!_* ”
- Susan: “ It's *karma*! People from our class aren't meant to have dealings with those poor bastards! ”
- Jimmy: “ Makes sense! Hey, Susan, what do you think about us? ”
- Susan: “ You mean me and you? Are you serious? ”
- Jimmy: “ Yeah, why not? *_If we were to tie the knot, we would both have our freedom,_* if you know what I mean. *_Getting married should benefit both our families’ businesses. Plus, no more fees for WeeChat Tip on Apple's channels! We’d be one big happy family!_* ”
- Susan: “ You love me? ”
- Jimmy: “ Not really, but you look gorgeous. I’m tired of this love game now. You look good, and that’s enough.”
- Susan: “ Have our freedom? ”
- Jimmy: “ Have our freedom! ”
- Susan: “ Alright! Let’s get married! ”

几天后，Michael、Sally、Susan，还有 Jimmy，这四个曾经的大学同学一起去民政局办理了离婚手续，Michael 净身出户，Susan 也没能带走 Tancent 的任何资产，之后，四个人又一起办理了结婚手续，之后，Michael 和 Sally 在城中村租了一间小屋，开启了新的生活。

- Michael: “ I'm sorry, darling, it's all my fault. *_If I hadn’t made such unforgivable mistake back then, you wouldn't have suffered so much, Max wouldn't have spent all these years not knowing who his real dad is, and you two wouldn’t be reduced to this today._* ”
- Sally: “ Don't say that, honey, at least we still have our son, right? ”
- Michael: “ Yeah, at least we still have our son, though we live in the slums now. *_You know what, even if somebody gave me a billion dollars, I wouldn't give up our life here. Even if Apple and Tancent were handed over to me, I wouldn't abandon you and Max for them._* ”
- Sally: “Darling, if I had to choose again, I would still divorce Jimmy and choose you. I only love you! Max, come call Daddy!”
- Max: “ I don't want to live here! I want a Bugatti! ”

== 名词性从句中的虚拟语气【表示意愿】

如果名词性从句中含有特定的、表示强烈主观意志的标志性单词，则从句的谓语动词必须使用原形形式（英式英语使用 should + 动词原形）， 此类表示强烈主观意志的标志性单词大多表示 愿望、建议、命令、请求等 ，这类标志词包括但不限于： ask, advise, command, beg, request, suggest, demand, decide, deserve, desire, insist, order, prefer, propose, urge。(意愿就是，说话人希望某事儿发生，但是这件事还没有发生，他认为应该发生，发生了就是好事儿)

-  Michael *insisted* that this marriage *be ended* as soon as possible.
- Jimmy *demanded* that Sally *not be allowed* to take any property because she was at fault for getting pregnant with Michael’s child.
- Sally *suggested* that they *start* a new life in the slums given their dire financial situation.
- Max *asked* that his father *divorce* Sally to remarry Susan because he was fed up with delivery work.

一定要区别相关词汇是否表达了真实的、强烈的主观意志

- Sally *suggested* that they start a new life in the slums given their dire financial situation.(虚拟语气)
- Sally‘s unusual behavior *suggested* that she had been pregnant with Michael’s child for quite some time.(这里suggest不是虚拟语气，而是"表明"的意思，可以换成show，indicate)
- Michael *insisted* that this marriage be ended as soon as possible.(虚拟语气)
- Susan *insisted* that it was Michael who was at fault.(这里是陈述事实)
