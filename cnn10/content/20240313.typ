Hello, and Wonderful Wednesday to you. I'm Coy Wire , bringing you best ten minutes in news right here on CNN10. It is your word Wednesday, so to see if your words submission made it into today's show.

Nations with people heading to the polls this year include some of the most powerful and wealthiest country in the world, as well as the most populous like Indian, South Africa, Mexico and in Europe, where United Kingdom is leaning towards elections later this year.

AI generated fake videos , deepfakes, could trigger voters into believing their watching and hearing a presidential candidate, when in reality they're not.

Yesterday in the U.S., voters in Georgia, Hawaii, Mississippi and State of Washington cast their ballots in their respective primaries. It is expected the both president Joe Biden and the former president Donald Trump will clinch their parties nomination.
Let's turn now to out Simon Cullen, who breaks down this crucial election this year for several nations across the world.

2024 is an election year like none other.
(Trump)We will turn the page forever on the miserable nightmare of the Biden presidency
(Biden)Donald Trump sees the different of the America, an American story of resentment, revenge and retribution. 
While the U.S. presidential race might be the highest profile, it's just one of dozens taking place internationally, covering more than half the world's populatio.

Many country, the health of their demoncracy itself will be being put to the test.

And the outcome has a potential to reshape international affairs on a scale rarely seen.

While the results of some elections are all but guaranteed, others will be a genuine contest , meaning a relatively small shift in voter support could affect the outcome . That amplifies the potential impact of disinformation. And experts warn that risk is made even more significant, but the fact of these information are are coinciding with a boom in Artificial Intelligence.

That brings with the prospect of deepfake content like this:

People should be scared, because the technology is enabling the creation of fake videos. They could be very persuasive with the ordinary voters. People are not going to be able to distinguish the fake videos from real ones.

Governments are not ready. There are literally no guardrails in place.
That's prompted dozens of technology companies to step in, signing an accord aimed at combating the misuse of Artificial Intelligence in elections.

Democracies depend on free and fair elcetions. Free and fair elections depend on trustworthy information, and trustworthy information depends on transparency about the nature and the provenance of that information.

They've also agreed on the need to respond more quickly when deceptive AI generated material spreads online. But even they concede the task ahead won't be easy. We are combating not just individuals, unfortunately, but well-resourced nation states including one in particular.

Even though the the Kremlin denies it, countless Intelligence reports confirm Russia's elections interference efforts. But the Microsoft president warns Russia's level of sophistication is growing, fueled by advances in Artificial Intelligence.

你好，我是Coy Wire，欢迎收看CNN10，为您带来最精彩的十分钟新闻。今天是“你的词汇星期三”，让我们看看您的词汇是否出现在今天的节目中。

首先，让我们来看看2024年的选举。不仅美国，世界上许多国家今年都将举行重要的全国选举。这些国家包括一些最强大和最富有的国家，以及人口最多的国家，如印度、南非、墨西哥，以及欧洲的英国，后者可能会在今年晚些时候举行选举。此外，拥有数亿选民的国家还将前往投票站选举欧洲联盟的新议会。

今年选举的一个主要关切点是先进技术，尤其是人工智能，以及它如何有可能通过虚假信息来影响和误导选民。由AI生成的虚假视频，即“deepfakes”，可能会让选民相信他们正在观看和听到一位总统候选人的讲话，而实际上并非如此。

昨天，在美国，佐治亚州、夏威夷州、密西西比州和华盛顿州的选民投票选举了各自的初选候选人。预计总统乔·拜登和前总统唐纳德·特朗普都将赢得各自党派的提名。

现在，让我们听听Simon Cullen的解读，他将为我们分析今年世界各国的关键选举。

2024年是一个与众不同的选举年。

（特朗普）我们将永远翻开拜登总统令人痛苦的噩梦一页。 （拜登）唐纳德·特朗普看到了美国的不同，这是一个充满怨恨、复仇和报复的美国故事。 虽然美国总统竞选可能是最引人注目的，但这只是全球数十个选举之一，涵盖了超过世界人口的一半。

许多国家，甚至是民主本身的健康，都将面临考验。

选举结果有可能在罕见的程度上重塑国际事务。

虽然某些选举的结果几乎可以预料，但其他选举将是真正的竞争，这意味着选民支持的微小变化可能会影响结果。这加大了虚假信息的潜在影响。专家警告说，这种风险变得更加重要，因为这些信息的事实恰好与人工智能的蓬勃发展同时出现。

这就带来了深度伪造内容的前景，比如这个： 这是一个由人工智能生成的视频，展示了技术近年来的进步。 即使是俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·普京也会在电脑生成的自己面前感到短暂的惊讶和困惑。 人们应该感到害怕，因为这项技术使制作虚假视频成为可能。这些视频可能对普通选民产生很大的说服力。人们将无法区分假视频和真实视频。 政府准备好应对即将到来的问题了吗？ 政府并没有准备好。实际上，根本没有任何防范措施。 这促使数十家科技公司加入，签署了一项旨在打击选举中人工智能滥用的协议。

民主制度依赖于自由和公正的选举。自由和公正的选举依赖于可靠的信息，而可靠的信息则取决于对信息性质和来源的透明度。

这项协议要求全球领先的科技公司开发工具，以帮助识别和标记由人工智能生成的内容。他们还一致认为，在欺骗性的人工智能生成材料在网上传播时，需要更快地做出回应。但即使如此，他们也承认前方的任务并不容易。我们正在与不仅仅是个人，而且还包括一个特定的、资源充足的国家进行斗争。

尽管克里姆林宫否认了这一点，但无数的情报报告证实了俄罗斯干预选举的努力。但微软总裁警告说，俄罗斯的技术水平正在不断提高，这得益于人工智能的进步。

这是一个严峻的挑战，我们需要密切关注这一领域的发展，以保护选举的公正性和透明度。

== SAT(Scholastic Aptitude Test)

No need to bring your NO.2 pencils to #strike[the] #underline[an] SAT anymore, because this college admission#underline[s] test is now full digital. Test takers still #strike[ought] #underline[have] to be there in person and supervised, so no bad #underline[*badinage*] with friends #strike[doing] #underline[during] the test. The SAT will be taking on #strike[the] #underline[a] laptop or tablet. And the exam will be shorter#strike[ where] #underline[. Where] #strike[there] #underline[it] was three hours before, it now down to two. It will still be based on the #strike[60 hundred] #underline[16 hundred-point] scale and #underline[the] results will come back sooner, in a matter of days in stead of weeks. But #underline[a] concern for some, these digital version is also adpative#strike[.Many were served] #underline[, meaning it will serve] #strike[hard] #underline[harder] questions#strike[,] the better you do, which some students say increases test anxiety and overthinking. This changes from the college #strike[border] #underline[board] #strike[on] #underline[are an] effort to make #strike[standard tests] #underline[this standardized test] more accessible to students, as many colleges make it optional to #underline[submit] standardized test scores especially during the pandemic. More #underline[elite] universities have announced a shift #strike[on] #underline[in now] requiring students to include this test scores with their applications. But on the other side, some #underline[critics] believe standardized tests can be a disadvantage for lower income students, because they may have limited resources to study and prepare for these tests.
