== You Do You Friday

So today is Monday, first day of the school week, first day of the work week for most #strike[of us]#underline[folks], but does#strike[n't] #underline[it] have to be that way? #underline[Whether you're *tightening screws*] on #strike[the]#underline[an] assembly line#strike[, the ...] #underline[or *crunching*] numbers on the computer, people have been working for five days #strike[of] a week for a long time. Henry Ford standardized the practice about a hundred years ago when he required the employees at his Ford Motor Company factories to work 40-hour weeks or 8 hours a day for 5 days. A century later though, some companies are reconsidering whether that schedule still make#underline[s] sense. CNN's Clare DUFFY has more:

We went from desktop#underline[s] to laptop#underline[s], to mobiles#underline[.] #strike[to]#underline[We're] working working and working. And there was no discussion around, #strike[where]#underline[wait,] this #strike[is]#underline[has gotten] out of control.

Preventing employee#strike[s for now] #underline[*burnout*] has become such an important priority that nearly one third of large U.S. companies are exploring shorter work weeks. One of them is Exos, a performance #strike[willness]#underline[*wellness*] company. CEO Sarah Robb O'Hagan, saw the #underline[burnout] and wanted to fix it.

Her answer was something called "You do you Fridays."

So tell us about "You do you Fridays", what does that mean?

So it means "You do you". So you #strike[play]#underline[may] choose to say, this Friday I'm exhausted, I need to go #strike[spin]#underline[spend] time #strike[on]#underline[out] hiking. Other people may say Friday is my #strike[date,]#underline[day to] just #underline[do quiet] work and not be disturbed. But what we *put #strike[to the]#underline[in] place* was you can not email#underline[,] text, #strike[right ...]#underline[write to any of your colleagues. You can't set] meetings. It is "You do you Friday" and what goes *hand #strike[on]#underline[in] hand* with "You do you Friday" is how we#strike[ek] constructed the other days of the week. We *structured* this because we know actually from training high performance athletes that you put a lot of load on them and then you follow #strike[was] #underline[it with] really intentional recovery to get more out of how the athletes performing. So think about us in the *workplace*, like if we are working, 80-hour weeks, 70-hour weeks#underline[,] which some people are#underline[,] it's #underline[like how *on earth* is] your body #underline[ever] recovery#strike[ of caution]#underline[. Of course you're] gonna #strike[be]#underline[get] burned out. #underline[So] the more #strike[weekend helped ...]#underline[we can help to introduce] this concept that recovery isn't #strike[a week]#underline[weak], it's actually a part of preparing you for high#underline[er] performance. I think it's better for all of us.

Robb O'Hagan *partner#underline[ed]* with the University of #strike[is working in school]#underline[Pennsylvania's Wharton School] to study how a four-day work week #underline[*impacted*] employee performance. During the six months of study, Exos also reported that employee burn#strike[ ]out #strike[job]#underline[dropped] from 70% to 30%.

It#strike['s something]#underline[ sounds] like #strike[these]#underline[this] works #underline[*in part*] because Exos#underline['s culture] #strike[this culture] is already structured in this way#strike[. We're] #underline[where you] #strike[having]#underline[have] employees #underline[who are probably already having] a lot of freedom over their hours. Do think this is something that #strike[gonna]#underline[can] work anywhere?

Yeah, that's funny. We get #strike[us ...]#underline[asked that question] a lot. And I actually do like.. I think it requires leadership really being #underline[*innovative* in] how they think about what work really is. Every industry can really think about is there a way to *stagger shifts*. #strike[Other]#underline[Are there] ways#underline[,] even #underline[if] you #underline[can't do the] four-day work week to really think about what we call a recovery first culture.

So today is Monday, first day of the school week, first day of the work week for most folks, but does it have to be that way? Whether you're tightening screws on an assembly line or crunching numbers on the computer, people have been working for five days  a week for a long time. Henry Ford standardized the practice about a hundred years ago when he required the employees at his Ford Motor Company factories to work 40-hour weeks or 8 hours a day for 5 days. A century later though, some companies are reconsidering whether that schedule still makes sense. CNN's Clare DUFFY has more:

But what we put in place was you can not email, text, write to any of your colleagues. You can't set meetings. It is "You do you Friday" and what goes hand in hand with "You do you Friday" is how we constructed the other days of the week. We structured this because we know actually from training high performance athletes that you put a lot of load on them and then you follow  it with really intentional recovery to get more out of how the athletes performing. So think about us in the workplace, like if we are working, 80-hour weeks, 70-hour weeks, which some people are, it's like how on earth is your body ever recovery. Of course you're gonna get burned out. So the more we can help to introduce this concept that recovery isn't weak, it's actually a part of preparing you for higher performance. I think it's better for all of us.

Robb O'Hagan partnered with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School to study how a four-day work week impacted employee performance. During the six months of study, Exos also reported that employee burnout dropped from 70% to 30%.

It sounds like this works in part because Exos's culture  is already structured in this way where you have employees who are probably already having a lot of freedom over their hours. Do think this is something that can work anywhere?

Yeah, that's funny. We get asked that question a lot. And I actually do like.. I think it requires leadership really being innovative in how they think about what work really is.

今天是星期一，大多数人认为这是学校周的第一天，也是工作周的第一天，但真的非得这样吗？无论你是在流水线上拧螺丝还是在电脑上处理数字，人们已经一周工作五天很长时间了。Henry Ford大约一百年前在他的福特汽车公司工厂标准化了这种做法，他要求员工每周工作40小时，即每天8小时，每周5天。然而，一个世纪后，一些公司正在重新考虑这种安排是否仍然合理。CNN的Clare Duffy有更多报道：

我们从台式电脑到笔记本电脑，再到移动设备，一直在工作工作再工作。没有人讨论，这已经失控了。

防止员工倦怠已成为如此重要的优先事项，以至于近三分之一的大型美国公司正在探索缩短工作周。其中之一是Exos，一家健康表现公司。首席执行官Sarah Robb O'Hagan看到了倦怠现象，想要解决它。

她的答案是所谓的“You Do You Friday”。

那么，告诉我们“You Do You Friday”是怎么回事？

意思是“You Do You”。所以你可以选择说，这个星期五我太累了，我需要出去徒步旅行。其他人可能会说星期五是我安静工作的日子，不想被打扰。但我们实施的规定是你不能给任何同事发邮件、短信、写信，不能安排会议。这就是“You Do You Friday”。与“You Do You Friday”相伴随的是我们如何安排一周的其他几天。我们这样安排是因为我们实际上从训练高水平运动员中了解到，你对他们施加大量负荷，然后进行非常有意图的恢复，以便更好地发挥运动员的表现。所以想象一下我们在工作场所，如果我们每周工作80小时，70小时，有些人确实是这样，那你的身体如何恢复？你当然会倦怠。所以我们越多地帮助引入这种概念，即恢复不是软弱，而是为更高表现做准备的一部分。我认为这对我们所有人都更好。

Robb O'Hagan与宾夕法尼亚大学沃顿商学院合作研究了四天工作周对员工表现的影响。在为期六个月的研究期间，Exos还报告说员工倦怠率从70%下降到30%。

听起来这部分有效是因为Exos的文化已经这样安排，员工可能已经有很多时间自由。你认为这种方法在任何地方都可以推广吗？

是的，这很有趣。我们经常被问到这个问题。我实际上认为这需要领导层在思考工作本质时真正具有创新精神。每个行业都可以真正考虑是否有办法错开班次。即使你不能做到四天工作周，也要真正考虑我们所谓的“恢复优先”文化。

Today's Monday #strike[which is considered as]#underline[,] the first day of the school #strike[days]#underline[week], as well as the first day of the work #strike[days]#underline[week]#strike[by most of us]. But does it have to be #strike[like this]#underline[that way]? #strike[Whatever you]#underline[Whether you're tightening] screw#underline[s] #strike[things] #strike[in]#underline[on] an assembly line or #strike[do a data processing]#underline[*crunching numbers*] #strike[in]#underline[on] a computer, people have been working for 5 days a week for a long time. Henry Ford standardized the practice about 100 years ago #strike[at his Ford Car Company, who]#underline[when he] asked #strike[workers]#underline[employees at his Ford Motor Company factories] to work 40 hours a week, meaning 8 hours every day#strike[, and 5 days a week]#underline[for five days]. However, a #strike[decade]#underline[century] passed, some companies are reconsidering whether such a schedule #strike[is still reasonable]#underline[still *makes sense*]. CNN's Clare Duffy has more:

#underline[We went] from #strike[computers]#underline[desktops] to laptops, to mobiles, we are working, working and working. There's no discussion. It has been out of control.

#strike[Avoiding workers]#underline[Preventing employee] burnout has been #strike[so prioritized]#underline[such an important priority] that nearly one third of the large U.S. companies are exploring #strike[how to shorten their work days]#underline[shorter work weeks]. One of the companies is Exos, a performance wellness company. CEO Sarah Robb O'Hagan saw the burnout and wanted to #strike[solve]#underline[fix] it.

Her answer #strike[is]#underline[was something called] "You Do You Friday".

So tell us what is "You Do You Friday"?

It means "You Do You". So you can choose to say, I am exhausted this Friday, a foot trip is required. Others may say, Friday is the day #strike[I can work quietly without being disturbed]#underline[to just do quiet work and not be disturbed]. But what #strike[our rules are]#underline[we put in place was that] you are not allowed to email, text or write to any of your colleagues, you can't set meetings. This is "You Do You Friday"#strike[. Along with]#underline[and what *goes hand in hand with*] "You Do You Friday" is how we #strike[schedule]#underline[construct] the other day#underline[s] of the week. #strike[The reason why we schedule like this]#underline[We *structured this*] is because we have learnt from training high performance athletes that you #underline[*put a lot of load*] on them and then #strike[give them an intentional recovery to make their performance better]#underline[you follow it with really intentional recovery to get more out of how the athletes performing]. So image when at workplaces, if we do 80-hour week work, 70-hour week work, #underline[which] some people #strike[work like this indeed]#underline[are indeed], how #underline[*on earth*] does your body #underline[ever] recover? You of course #strike[will burn out]#underline[are gonna get burned out]. #strike[So we help introduce the conception more]#underline[So the more we can help to introduce this concept] that recovery isn't weak but a part of #strike[preparation]#underline[preparing you] for higher performance. I think it's better for all of us.

Robb O'Hagan partnered with the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School and studied #strike[the influence of 4-day week work on employees]#underline[how a four-day work week impacted employee performance]. During the six months #underline[of] study, Exos reported that the rate of #underline[employee] burnout dropped from 70% to 30%.

It sounds like #strike[effective]#underline[this works *in part*] because the culture in Exos has #strike[scheduled,]#underline[structured in this way where you have] employees #underline[who are] probably already have lots of free time over their hours. Do you think #strike[it's a method that can be introduced anywhere] #underline[this is something that can work anywhere]?

Yes, it's interesting. We get asked the question a lot. I actually think it requires #strike[the] leadership to be innovative in #strike[thinking]#underline[how they think about] what #strike[the] work really #strike[are]#underline[is]. #strike[Each job]#underline[Every industry] can think about if there's a way to #strike[make a]#underline[*stagger*] shifts. Even though you can't do 4-day work week, you should consider what we call #strike[the culture of "Recovery Priority"] #underline[a recovery first culture].

== Lady Elliot Island

Next we're taking a trip to one of those islands, Lady Elliot Island, located at #underline[the *southernmost tip*] of Great Barrier Reef. The island is #underline[*lush*] with #underline[*greenery* again], *regrowing* after decades of *topsoil* mining. But now there's a new threat to this #underline[*delicate*] ecosystem -- mass coral #underline[*bleaching*]. CNN's Ivan Watso has more:

An hour #strike[after]#underline[*off*] the #strike[cost]#underline[coast] of Brisbane, Australia, lies a tiny paradise island, only accessible by aircraft. But it didn't always look like this. It has been through incredible transformation led by one man. Landing here is tricky. My pilot is Peter Gash. He basically owns the island, #underline[*leasing* it] from the Australian government and running a eco#underline[-resort] #strike[result] here with his family.

Meanwhile, above this surface, the island #underline[*teems*] with sea birds.

In the 19th century, settlers #strike[minded]#underline[*mined*] the island for the bird #underline[*guano*] leaving the place mostly #underline[*barren*] hard coral.

Peter's message #strike[with]#underline[of] hope is inspiring, but it's tempered by something we see under water. #underline[*Amid* the reef sharks] and sea turtles, there's coral #underline[*bleached*] white, enough to worry this island's #underline[greatest *enthusiast*].

The damaged coral here, part of #underline[the mass bleaching event caused by the marine heat wave along the Great Barrier Reef], a #underline[*phenomenon*] that could threaten the entire ecosystem.

接下来我们将前往其中一个岛屿，位于大堡礁最南端的Lady Elliot Island。经过数十年的表土开采后，这个岛屿再次充满了绿色植物，正在重新生长。但现在，这个脆弱的生态系统面临着一个新的威胁——大规模珊瑚白化。CNN的Ivan Watso带来了更多报道：

离澳大利亚布里斯班海岸一小时路程，有一个只能通过飞机到达的小天堂岛。但它并不总是像现在这样。它经历了一场由一人领导的惊人转变。降落在这里并不容易。我的飞行员是Peter Gash。他基本上拥有这个岛，从澳大利亚政府租赁并和家人在这里经营一个生态度假村。

与此同时，岛上的天空中充满了海鸟。

19世纪时，定居者在岛上开采鸟粪，导致这里几乎变成了光秃秃的硬珊瑚。

Peter的希望信息令人鼓舞，但我们在水下看到的情况让人心情复杂。在礁鲨和海龟之间，有白化的珊瑚，足以让这个岛屿最热心的爱好者担忧。

这里受损的珊瑚是大堡礁沿海海洋热浪引发的大规模白化事件的一部分，这种现象可能威胁整个生态系统。
