== Titok

Hello, Superstar! And welcome to CNN10, #strike[Well, I'll tell you what let you decide and what to think.]where I tell you the what, letting you decide waht to think. I'm *Coy Wire*. And we begin #strike[ at ] #underline()[_on_] nation's capital, #strike[ of ] where House *lawmakers* are quickly moving *ahead* on legislation that could possibly ban the popular social media app Titok from the United States. 

Titok is used by about 170 millon of Americans#strike[. But], but this measure is looking to prohibit Titok from #strike[the USA] U.S. app stores unless the app is no longer connected to Byte Dance, its parent company, which is based in China. 

Some lawmakers are concerned that Titok could possibly enable the Chinese government to have too much information about its users#strike[. A legend], alleging that #strike[is] it's a possible national security threat. 

On the other side, Titok denies #strike[this] these claims and believes this legislation is #strike[in] an attack #strike[of] on #strike[the] First #strike[man] *Amendment* rights. #strike[ This propose to .. has part ... support, ]This *proposed bill* has bipartisan support and is scheduled to be voted by the house quickly. If the bill eventually does make its way to President Biden's desk, the White #strike[House's] House says Biden would sign it. Now if this proposed bill is put into the law, it will allow Titok about 5 months to cut ties with Byte Dance. If ties were not to be cut, this measure would prohibit Titok to be downloaded on app stores in the U.S. Here's are *Manu Raju* with more.

#strike[ The house ... plan to ... legislation, ... ]The House *plowing ahead with* the plan to *take up legislation* to essentially ban Titok if the Chinese firm, ByteDance doesn't sell it *They are trying to* force that sale #strike[ . That's .. because ... ] because of concerns that Chinese government is too close to private information of Americans. They are alleging that Chinese government #strike[ are easy to .. ] *is interfering* with that information and could #strike[ exploded something ] *exploit it, something* that ByteDance has furious denied. But #strike[ remember this] nevertheless, this #strike[ is why the ... ] #underline[_has wide bipartisan_] support approved by *the House Energy and Commerce Committee* last week, 50 to nothing. #strike[ It's ] That is something that rarely seen on *Capital Hill*, #underline[_but that bipartisan support ultimately forcing the House Majority Leader to_] put this bill on the *floor* very quickly. *Steve Scalise said* he #strike[will] would take #underline[_up_] this measure #strike[the fully household, and] #underline[_ the full House in_] just a matter of days. That doesn't the mean though Titok #underline[_isn't_] trying to kill it. #underline()[_In fact_], #strike[And ByteDance] that's ByteDance exactly #strike[_would_] #underline[_what they're_] trying to do #strike[that top.] #underline[_The top Republican who chairs the Energy and Commerce Committee told me that_] she is getting flooded with phone calls over people opposed to the efforts.

Yes, we've been flooded with calls, #underline[_record amounts of calls_].  Any member of *the Energy and Commerce Committee* that voted yesterday has been flooded. #underline[_The co-sponsors have been flooded._] 
Titok actually put up a notice #strike[ that ] #underline[_where_] they blocked an individual #underline[_to actually get on TikTok_] unless you called #underline[_your member_] of Congress and told them #underline[_not to vote for_] this legislation.
But that's just a example of how they can manipulate data and influence on Americans #underline[_for their agenda_]

But what #underline[_will happen in the Senate?_] That was a completely different question. #strike[ All together year ]Altogether here, #underline[_the senators_] has some #strike[ other ] of their own ideas #underline[_, but it could_] take some time to get through. But if it does become a #underline[_law_] , president Biden said, he will sign it.

== Muslim

#strike()[Next,] #underline()[_Next up_] in the Muslim canlendar, one of the holist #strike()[secret months] #underline()[_most sacred months_] #strike()[, it's] #underline()[_is_] the ninth month, or *Ramadan*. Several Muslim countries announced the Monday as the first day of Ramadan, and the holy month #underline()[_of fasting,_] where Muslim may not consume food or drinks from sunrise and sunset. The exact start date of Ramadan changes because it's based on #underline()[_*clerics* seeing a *crescent*_] or new moon as the *Islamic* canlendar follows the lunar cycle. 

There were #underline()[_hopes of a possible ceasefire in the Gaza Strip_] before start the Ramadan, but both Hamas and *Israel* could not reach a deal. While the war goes on, there's *humanitarian* crisis that continues to *grapple the Gaza Strip*  The U.S. #underline()[_is teaming up_] with several other nations by airdropping #underline()[_aid_] into Gaza , but #underline()[_aid_] agencies recommended it would be much more efficient if this supplies were transported on the ground. Our chief international *correspondent*, *Clarissa Ward*, is here to give us the why.

From the #strike()[house] #underline()[_health_] ministry inside Gaza are now saying that 25 have died as a result of #underline()[_acute malnutrition and dehydration_]. #strike()[They] #underline()[_CNN_] cannot independently confirm that, because the international journalists are not allowed into Gaza to report on the ground. But it certainly #strike()[jails] #underline()[_gels_] with what we have #strike()[here] #underline()[_been hearing_] from the groups like the *U.N.*, who has warned that hundreds of thousands of #underline()[_of Gazans in the northern_] part of the *enclave* are one step away from *famine*, who has announced as you mentioned that four out of five(4/5) people -- or 4/5 household, I should say specifically, do not have access any longer to clean water. And #underline()[_while these_] airdrops show a certrain level of intention and #strike()[good will] #underline()[_goodwill_] they#underline()[_,_] according to #underline()[_aid_] organizations#underline()[_,_] are not terribly efficient and effective in terms of #underline()[_machanism for actually distributing aid._] We heard from one humanitarian worker who said #strike()[there was] #underline()[_they're_] a great *photo op* , but they are terrible in terms of trying to make sure that people on the ground get the aid they need.

== Kenya

Let's head to Kenya now, where the #strike[eastern] #underline[East] country is dealing with #strike[the] #underline[_a_] rise #underline[_in the *rhinoceros*_] of population. #underline[_Overcrowding_] in #underline[_*sanctuaries* has_] cause problem #strike[that] #underline[_such as rhinos attacking_] each other and competing for food. It's such a concern that Kenya #strike[of wide] #underline[_Wildlife Service_] is transporting 21 rhinos to a new location.

It takes nearly a dozen people to get this #underline[_five-year-old black rhino up on its feet as the *tranquilizer* *wears off*._] With #underline[_tracker_] securely #underline[_*glued to* her horn,_] she is ready to move 100 hundred miles away. Kenya has an unusual problem. Rhino populations here are actually going up, so Safia and others have this overcrowded #strike[century] #underline[_sancturay in central_] Kenya #strike[, a] #underline[are] getting a new home. Decades ago, 20,000 eastern black rhinos like this one run free in Africa. But in just under 20 years the numbers #underline[_*plummeted*_] to below 400 as #underline[_*poachers*_] hunted them for their precious #underline[_*horns*_]. Now Kenya rhinos #underline[_are making a comebac_] thanks to #underline[_anti-poaching efforts_] #strike[anchors]. But overcrowding in #strike[centuries] #underline[_sanctuaries_] has become a problem for a #underline[_*solitary*_] animal.

To #strike[get them more living space] #underline[_give them more roaming space_], 21 rhinos were taking to a brand new sancturay in #underline[Loisaba Conservancy]. They #strike[had] #underline[are] the first rhino#underline[s] to live on the land in #strike[15] #underline[50] years.

== Bird

For today's #underline[story's getting a] 10 out of 10, a video#underline[-bombing] bird doing its best to break up #strike[and] #underline[a] beat on broadcast tv. CNN's #underline[Jeanne Moos] has more.

Look at this, reporters are supposed to be able to #underline[_*wing it*_], but this is something #strike[like] #underline[out of the] birds. Ok, maybe not that #strike[stream] #underline[extreme]. But #underline[Australia reporter Ursula Heger] was #strike[fighting] #underline[_*filing*_] a #underline[report] for 10 News First#strike[. When] #underline[when] she got #underline[dive-bombed] over and over. #underline[dive-bombed] #strike[for] nine times. Her own station called it #underline[_*impeckable* *journalism*_]  Instead doing this, #underline[Ursula did this.]  

#strike[We should] #underline[_At least she didn't_] get used #strike[to] a landing #underline[_strip_] by, say, a #underline[_*robin*_] or a #underline[_pet_] parrot. And Ursula didn't get #strike[his] #underline[_her_] earbud #underline[_*plucked*_] by this reporter in #underline[_*Chile*_]
Ironically, he was reporting on the rising *roberies*. They did manage to get the earbud back from the parrot.

#underline[_The way Ursula_] handle the attack #strike[as the ...] #underline[_was a feather in her cap._] #underline[_Could have been worse if she got_] #strike[She would be] pecked by a *woodpecker*.

Talk about #underline[_*foul play* and a "hawkward"_] situation, but that reporter had no #underline[_*egrets*_] taking the #strike[bird] #underline[_"birden"_] in #underline[_*stride*_], #strike[delivery] #underline[_delivering_] #strike[a peckable] #underline[_an impeckable report that was like *poultry*_] report in motion.

All right. Remember tomorrow's ... follow me . I'm Coy Wire. 
#underline[_Drop_] your unique vocabulary #underline[_in the comment section on my most recent post and_] we're suppose to choose a winner to work into tomorrow show.
