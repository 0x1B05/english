我们从医生抗议开始。成千上万名医生走上首尔的街头，表达对已经罢工近两周的成千上万名医生的支持。这一切都是因为政府计划增加医学院的招生计划。该计划包括从2025学年开始增加该国的医学院招生2000人，这将使每年的招生总数达到约5000人。政府表示，这一计划旨在帮助满足韩国面临的挑战性医疗需求，因为韩国的医生人口比例是发达国家中最低的之一。但医生们不同意政府的方法，他们认为他们的医学院系统无法承受如此大规模的增加，教育和培训新的医学生。他们还担心，拟议的计划不包括在已经出现短缺的特定领域的人员配备，如儿科和急诊科。医生们还担心，增加新医生将导致公共医疗费用的增加。但这次抗议并没有真正赢得公众的支持。最近的一项调查显示，大多数韩国人支持政府的计划，一些批评人士称，医生只是担心在这个领域面临更多竞争后收入会减少。在罢工持续进行的同时，该国卫生部表示，政府已允许军队医生和护士执行一些通常由这些罢工医生执行的医疗程序。
