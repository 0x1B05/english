What's up lovely people! Hope you've had an awesome weekend. Let's start this week strong with some motivation Monday. Remeber #strike[complecency] #underline[complacency] is the constant enemy, so let's learn one thing or do something that #strike[makes] #underline[will make] us a little better today than we were yesterday. I'm Coy Wire, this is CNN10.

== Korean doctors

We start with doctors protesting--thousands of doctors taking to the street in #strike[South of Korea] #underline[_Seoul, South Korea_], expressing support for the many more thousands of doctors who have been on #strike[straight] #underline[*strike*] for nearly two weeks. This all because the government's plan to increase medical school admissions. The plan includes increasing the country's medical school #strike[and ...] #underline[*enrollment*] by 2,000#underline[,] starting in the 2025 _academic year_. That will bring the total to about 5,000 per year. The government says this plan is to help #strike[me] #underline[meet] the challenging #strike[health care] #underline[*healthcare*] demands #strike[the] #underline[as] South Korea faces, one of the lowest doctor #underline[to] population ratios for a developed country. But doctors disagree with government's method _in believes_ their medical school system can not _handle of_ #strike[fast] #underline[vast] increased educating and training new medical students. Also they're concerned that proposed plan does not include _staffing_ in specific fields that have already been #strike[seen] #underline[seeing] a shortage such as #underline[*pediatrics*] and the emergency departments. Doctors are also worried that the addition of new doctors will lead to increase public medical expenses. But this protest have not really won public support. A recent survey showed a majority of the South #strike[Korea's] #underline[Koreans] #strike[outsiding] #underline[are siding] with government's plan #strike[was some critical sane.] #underline[with some critics saying,] doctors are just worried about receiving a lower income now with more competition in the field. With the strike _ongoing_, the country health ministry says the government has allowed military doctors and nurses to perform some medical procedures#strike[,] normally performed by these striking doctors.

大家好！希望你们度过了愉快的周末。让我们以充满动力的星期一开始这个新的一周。记住，自满是我们的永恒敌人，所以让我们学习一件事或做一些让自己比昨天更好的事情。我是Coy Wire，这里是CNN10。

我们从医生抗议开始。成千上万名医生走上首尔的街头，表达对已经罢工近两周的成千上万名医生的支持。这一切都是因为政府计划增加医学院的招生计划。该计划包括从2025学年开始增加该国的医学院招生2000人，这将使每年的招生总数达到约5000人。政府表示，这一计划旨在帮助满足韩国面临的挑战性医疗需求，因为韩国的医生人口比例是发达国家中最低的之一。但医生们不同意政府的方法，他们认为他们的医学院系统无法承受如此大规模的增加，教育和培训新的医学生。他们还担心，拟议的计划不包括在已经出现短缺的特定领域的人员配备，如儿科和急诊科。医生们还担心，增加新医生将导致公共医疗费用的增加。但这次抗议并没有真正赢得公众的支持。最近的一项调查显示，大多数韩国人支持政府的计划，一些批评人士称，医生只是担心在这个领域面临更多竞争后收入会减少。在罢工持续进行的同时，该国卫生部表示，政府已允许军队医生和护士执行一些通常由这些罢工医生执行的医疗程序。

== Weather

All right, let's turn now to weather as we first head to #underline[*Sierra Nevada*] mountain region#underline[, where *blizzard*] conditions continue to *slam* the area. Dangerous#underline[, *fierce*] winds #underline[of] more than 75 miles per hour#underline[,] _as well as_ the heavy snowfall #strike[threaten the ... of] #underline[*threatened* to *dump up* to] ten feet of snow in the mountain, has forced the officials to close down roads and impact travel. Many #strike[results] #underline[resorts] on the California#underline[-Nevada border] are also shut down, and about 6 million people in that region #underline[are in] a winter alert.

And let's head to another region, the #underline[*Texas Panhandle*] continuing to be #underline[*ravaged*] by the extremely hot and dry conditions, as the biggest #underline[*inferno*] in Texas history #underline[rages on.] The #strike[smoke ..] #underline[Smokehouse Creek] Fire has been #strike[burnt] #underline[burning] for nearly a week now, and destroyed more than 1 million #underline[acres] in the #strike[state of taxies] #underline[State of Texas] alone. It's a scary and #underline[*devastating*] reality many #strike[taxiers] #underline[Texans] are dealing with. Let's turn to our Camila Bernal for more:

It's been windy. It is hot, a lot hotter than it's been over the last couple of days. And it's #underline[dry,] conditions #underline[that] are making #underline[it] extremely difficult for firefighters in this area that still battling the largest #underline[wild]fire in Texas history#strike[ containment. It's] #underline[. *Containment* is] still very low, so there's a lot of work to be done.

We came back at 10:30 that night. #underline[We kind of *snuck through some ranches* to drive up here and see it gone. This was pretty tough.]

And you can hear the emotion#strike[ that's] #underline[. It's] been so difficult for members of this community. It also had a huge impact on the cattle industry here, because 85% percent of #strike[states] #underline[state's] cattle is raised here in #underline[the Panhandle.] And so a lot of #underline[*ranchers*] are also having to start from zero and have shared the struggle both emotionally and #underline[*financially*].

All right, let's turn now to weather as we first head to Sierra Nevada mountain region, where blizzard conditions continue to slam the area. Dangerous, fierce winds of more than 75 miles per hour, as well as the heavy snowfall threatened to dump up to ten feet of snow in the mountain, has forced the officials to close down roads and impact travel. Many resorts on the California-Nevada border are also shut down, and about 6 million people in that region are in a winter alert.

And let's head to another region, the Texas Panhandle continuing to be ravaged by the extremely hot and dry conditions, as the biggest inferno in Texas history rages on. The Smokehouse Creek Fire has been burning for nearly a week now, and destroyed more than 1 million acres in the State of Texas alone. It's a scary and devastating reality many Texans are dealing with. Let's turn to our Camila Bernal for more:

It's been windy. It is hot, a lot hotter than it's been over the last couple of days. And it's dry, conditions that are making it extremely difficult for firefighters in this area that still battling the largest wildfire in Texas history . Containment is still very low, so there's a lot of work to be done. And in the meantime, you have that grieving process beginning for a lot of families have lost everything, the cleaner process. And like, you are seeing behind me at Johnson house, and it's been difficult to do that cleanup because the wind have been so high. But nonetheless, you're seeing them right now they are trying to sift that debris, trying to look for any jewellery, anything they can find of what was left of their home, the home that they have built for over 20 years. I want want you to listen to what Ronnie Johnson told me when he first got here to his home after the fire.

We came back at 10:30 that night. We kind of snuck through some ranches to drive up here and see it gone. This was pretty tough.

现在让我们转向天气，首先我们来到内华达山脉地区，那里暴风雪条件持续肆虐。超过每小时75英里的危险猛烈风速，以及大雪威胁，可能会在山区堆积多达十英尺的积雪，已迫使官员关闭道路并影响旅行。加州和内华达州边境的许多度假胜地也关闭了，该地区约有600万人处于冬季警报状态。

接下来我们转向另一个地区，德克萨斯州的Panhandle地区持续受到极端炎热和干燥条件的摧残，因为德克萨斯州历史上最大的山火继续肆虐。Smokehouse Creek Fire已经燃烧了将近一个星期，仅在德克萨斯州就摧毁了100多万英亩的土地。这是很多德克萨斯人正在应对的可怕而毁灭性的现实。让我们听听我们的Camila Bernal的报道：

风势很大。天气非常炎热，比过去几天要热得多。而且非常干燥，这种条件使得在这个地区的消防员们面临极大困难，他们仍在与德克萨斯历史上最大的山火作斗争。控制火势的进展仍然很慢。所以还有很多工作要做。同时，许多家庭已经开始了失去一切的悲痛过程，清理过程也已经开始。就像你在我身后看到的，约翰逊家庭，由于风势太大，清理工作变得非常困难。但尽管如此，你现在看到他们正在努力清理残骸，试图寻找任何首饰，任何他们能找到的残留在家中的物品，这是他们建造了20多年的家。我想让你们听一下Johnson Ronnie告诉我的，他大火后第一个回到家看到的景象。

我们晚上10:30回来的。我们在一些农场间穿行，偷偷来到这里，结果发现家已经不在了。这真是太难了。

你可以听到他的情绪。对于这个社区的成员来说，这一切都非常艰难。这也对这里的牛肉产业产生了巨大影响，因为德克萨斯州85%的牛群在Panhandle饲养。因此，许多牧场主也不得不从零开始，他们在情感和经济上都承受着巨大的压力。他们知道要恢复到火灾前的状态需要很长时间。

When] #underline[when] we mentioned the development of new supersonic plane. #strike[we will take it] #underline[We're taking] a closer look today#strike[. And] #underline[at] what #strike[air spacing] #underline[*aerospace* and] defense company, *Lockheed Martin* has built #strike[an ...] #underline[and *debuted*] for NASA. The experimental plane is called X-59, and it's a #strike[quite] #underline[quiet] supersonic aircraft. NASA is looking to possibly #strike[evolutionize] #underline[revolutionize] the air #strike[travelling] #underline[travel] industry#strike[ by] #underline[. And by] that#underline[, I] mean go really fast, so fast that it could travel faster than the speed of sound. Take a look #underline[at] this piece, *profiling* the X-59:

This is the X-59 *quest*, a new plane built by Lockheed Martin for NASA. NASA is hoping it would be #strike[a solover of] #underline[able to solve a] problem that has stopped commercial air plane from flying really really fast, that's because:

When #strike[the] #underline[an] aircraft goes supersonic, faster than the speed of sound, it create shockwaves. When I heard the sonic boom for the first time, I finally understood why it was such a big deal. If something's travelling #strike[supersonicly] #underline[*supersonically*], you can see it coming but you won't hear it at all until it has already passed you. 

As you could image, sonic booms can be #strike[desruptive] #underline[*disruptive*] to life on the ground, so #strike[... 131953] #underline[disruptive that in 1973], the United States government #strike[alone] #underline[along] with much of the world #strike[ban] #underline[banned] all #strike[Soviet...] #underline[*civilian*] aircraft from supersonic #underline[flight] overland.

For the U.S., it's a speed limit.

The only #underline[civilian] jet #underline[to *ferry*] passengers faster than the speed of sound was the *Concorde*. It is #strike[the] only able to fly over the ocean supersonic.

NASA and Lockheed Martin are hoping this crazy looking airplane is a step in that direction. It is designed to go supersonic without making the loud sonic boom, we've #underline[been *accustomed*] to hearing for decades now. To understand how this might work, it's important to understand how a sonic boom happens. Just like a #strike[boom] #underline[boat], when the #strike[boom] #underline[boat] is moving, you get the #strike[way coming...] #underline[weight coming off of it], and it's #strike[worthy] #underline[with it] the entire time #strike[of] #underline[it's] travelling. Similarly for supersonic aircraft, the shockwaves *come off* the aircraft and travel to the ground the entire time #underline[it's flying supersonic.] So when engineers designed the X-59, #strike[the use of] #underline[they used] smooth and long #strike[air dynamic] #underline[aerodynamic] lines to limit their shockwaves from reaching the ground.

It is still #underline[*audible*] like a quiet #underline[*thump*.] And most people, if them hear it, won't even notice it.

All right, you might remember we were talking about the speed of sound about a month ago when we mentioned the development of new supersonic plane. We're taking a closer look today at what aerospace and defense company, Lockheed Martin has built and debuted for NASA. The experimental plane is called X-59, and it's a quiet supersonic aircraft. NASA is looking to possibly revolutionize the air travel industry . And by that, I mean go really fast, so fast that it could travel faster than the speed of sound.

NASA can take that data, and then be able to present that to the regulatory authorities to actually repeal the overline supersonic limitations or was that we have today.

A change in regulation could lead to a surge of investment in the next generation of commercial supersonic aircraft, making travel faster than the speed of sound, more accessible to everyone. And that could send massive shockwaves to the air travel industry. Shockwaves that the NASA and Lockheed Martin hope will sound more like thump.

也许你还记得大约一个月前我们谈论过声速时，提到了新超音速飞机的开发，今天我们将更详细地了解一下航空航天和国防公司Lockheed Martin为美国国家航空航天局（NASA）建造和首次亮相的新型实验飞机X-59。这架实验飞机被称为X-59，是一种静音超音速飞机。NASA希望能够彻底改变航空旅行业，我的意思是，实现真正的快速。如此之快，以至于能够比声速更快地行进。让我们来看一下这篇介绍X-59的文章：

这就是X-59探索者，一架由Lockheed Martin为NASA建造的新型飞机。NASA希望它能够解决商用飞机不让飞行非常快的问题，原因是：

当飞机超音速行进时，快于声速，会产生冲击波。当我第一次听到音爆时，我终于明白为什么这是个大问题了。如果某物以超音速行进，你可以看到它，但直到它已经经过你了，你才会听到声音。你可以想象，音爆会对地面生活造成干扰。1973年，美国政府与世界上许多国家一起禁止所有民用飞机在陆地上进行超音速飞行。对于美国来说，这是一种速度限制。

唯一一架运送乘客超音速的民用喷气式飞机是协和式飞机(Concorde)。它只能在海上进行超音速飞行。所以你可以从伦敦飞往纽约，但你必须在抵达纽约之前减速，转为次音速飞行。因此，航线非常有限。Concorde是一项备受赞誉的技术成就，也是其乘客的独特奢侈享受。有限的航线和高油耗意味着运营协和式飞机并不划算。然而，它在2003年停止飞行。但是，如果超音速飞机能够在陆地上飞行，它们可以飞往任何地方，商业提案就会发生变化。

NASA和Lockheed Martin希望这架看起来很疯狂的飞机是朝着这个方向迈出的一步。它被设计为在超音速行进时不发出我们几十年来习以为常的巨大音爆。要理解这种原理，了解声爆是如何发生的很重要。就像一艘船，当船在移动时，它带着船身上的重量一起移动。同样，对于超音速飞机，冲击波从飞机上脱落并在整个超音速飞行期间传播到地面。因此，当工程师设计X-59时，他们使用了光滑且长的空气动力学线条来限制冲击波到达地面。发动机于机翼上方，这样发动机产生的冲击波就无法传播到地面，只会向上传播。它仍然是可听到的，像一个轻微的隆隆声。大多数人，如果听到了，甚至都不会注意到。

NASA计划于2024年春季进行X-59的首次试飞。诗意地，就在加利福尼亚沙漠的同一块地方，Chuck Yeager首次在X-1上突破音障时。NASA可以利用这些数据，然后向监管机构提供，以实际废除我们今天所面临的超音速飞行限制。

法规的变化可能会导致下一代商用超音速飞机的投资激增，使超音速飞行对每个人都更加普遍。这可能会给航空旅行业带来巨大的冲击波。NASA和Lockheed Martin希望这些冲击波听起来更像是隆隆声。

Maybe you still remember #strike[we've talked] #underline[we were talking] about the speed of sound #strike[last month] #underline[about a month ago]#strike[,] #underline[when] we mentioned the development of supersonic plane. Today we #strike[are going to learn more about the new experimental plane X-59 which debuted and was built by Lockheed Martin]#underline[are taking a closer look today at what aerospace and defense company, Lockheed Martin has built and debuted] for NASA. This experimental plane was called X-59, a kind of #underline[quiet] supersonic plane. NASA is #strike[hoping] #underline[looking] to revolutionize the #strike[plane travelling] #underline[air travel] industry#strike[, which means implement the real speed] #underline[. And by that, I mean go really fast], so fast that it #strike[can drive] #underline[could travel] faster than the speed of sound. Let's take a look at #strike[the article about] #underline[this piece, profiling] X-59:

This is the X-59 quest, a new kind of plane built by Lockheed Martin for NASA. NASA is hoping it #strike[can] #underline[would] solve the problem #strike[of the business plane speed limitation] #underline[that has stopped comercial air plan from flying really really fast], that's because:

When a #strike[plane] #underline[aircraft] #strike[travels supersonicly] #underline[goes supersonic], faster than the speed of sound, it will create shockwaves. When I first heard of the #strike[shockwaves] #underline[sonic boom], I finally understood why it's #strike[a big problem] #underline[such a big deal]. If something #strike[travels] #underline[is travelling] supersonicly, you can see it #underline[coming], but you won't hear anything until it passed you.

As you #strike[can] #underline[could] imagine, #strike[shockwaves] #underline[sonic booms] #strike[will] #underline[can] be disruptive to the life on the ground#strike[. American] #underline[, so disruptive that in 1973, the United States] government along with #strike[many other countries across] #underline[much of] the world #strike[prohibited] #underline[banned] #strike[the] #underline[all] civilian aircraft from #strike[travelling supersonicly over the land in 1973] #underline[supersonic flight overland]. #strike[To] #underline[For] the U.S., it's a kind of speed limit.

The only civilian jet #strike[that is allowed] to #strike[carry] #underline[*ferry*] passengers is Concorde, but it is only enable to travel supersonic over the sea. So you #strike[can fly from] #underline[could do] London to New York, but before arriving New York, you #strike[must] #underline[got to] slow down #underline[and be subsonic], owing to which the routes are limited. Concorde is a #underline[*celebrated*] technical achievement#strike[ full of credit] #underline[, and an exclusive luxury for its passengers]. Limited routes and high fuel consumption #underline[meant that operating the Concorde was not goo business.] However it #strike[has been] stopped flying #strike[from] #underline[in] 2003. But if supersonic aircraft could fly #strike[over the land] #underline[overland], they can fly anywhere, and the #strike[future of business] #underline[business proposition] will change.

NASA and Lockheed Martin are hoping this crazy looking airplane is a step in that direction. It is designed #underline[without makeing the loud sonic boom we've been accustomed to for decades]. To understand #strike[this principle] #underline[how this might work], it is important to #strike[know how shockwaves are made] #underline[how a sonic boom happen]. Just like a boat, #strike[it moves along along with its weight] #underline[when the boat is moving, you get the weight coming off it and it's with it the entire time it's travelling]. Similarly, #strike[to] #underline[for] supersonic aircraft, shockwaves come off the plane and #strike[transport] #underline[travel] to the ground #strike[when] #underline[the entire time] it is flying. So when engineers are designing X-59, they limited shockwaves #strike[arriving at] #underline[from reaching the] ground with smooth and long aerodynamic lines. The engine is above the wing, so shockwaves from it #strike[can't spread] #underline[isn't able to go down] to the ground #strike[which] #underline[. It] only can go #strike[above] #underline[up].

It is still audible, like a slight thump. Most people won't notice it even they have heard of it.

NASA #strike[are planing] #underline[is aiming for] #strike[the first fly] #underline[a first flight] of X-59 in the spring of 2024. Poetically, #strike[in] #underline[over] the same #strike[place] #underline[patch] of California desert, where Chuck Yeager first broke the sound barrier in the X-1.

NASA can #strike[exploit it can provide] #underline[take that data, and then be able to present] it to the #strike[regulation organization] #underline[regulatory authorities] to repeal the #underline[overline supersonic] limitations #strike[in the speed of supersonic plane] we are confronting today.

The changes in regulation could lead to a #strike[boom in ...] #underline[surge of investment] in the next generation of #strike[business] #underline[commercial] supersonic aircraft, #strike[which makes] #underline[making travel faster than the speed of sound], more accessible to everyone. It has a potential to #strike[bring a] #underline[send a massive] shockwave to the air travel industry. NASA and Lockheed Martin hopes #strike[these shockwaves are more like thump] #underline[will sound more like thump].
