In #strike[the runs]#underline[Iran's] case, that religious leader is #underline[*supreme* leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei an Islamic] *fundamentalist*. Raisi, as president, was *second in command*. His death comes at #strike[the]#underline[a] tense moment for the entire Middle #strike[list]#underline[East]. #strike[There]#underline[It] was only weeks ago that Iran#strike['s] launched a #underline[full-scale drone] a #strike[mis-attack]#underline[missile attack] #strike[in]#underline[on] Israel.

大家好！Coy在这里，带着我们一起度过美好的星期二。不过，这也是让人百感交集的一周！夏天即将来临，这很棒，但这也是夏季休假前的最后一周节目。不过，我们在夏天还有一些计划，后续会有更多信息。

好了，让我们来看今天的新闻。在伊朗，军队总司令下令调查一起致命的直升机坠毁事件，这起事故震惊了全国。伊朗总统Ebrahim Raisi及其他几位官员在他们的直升机坠毁于该国西北部的偏远山区后遇难。事故发生时，现场有浓雾。Raisi是一个政治强硬派，2021年他轻松击败竞争对手、前总统Hassan Rouhani当选，总共获得了近2900万张选票中的1800万票。伊朗被视为一个伊斯兰共和国或神权国家，宗教领袖掌控国家。在伊朗，这位宗教领袖是最高领袖Ayatollah Ali Khamenei，一名伊斯兰原教旨主义者。作为总统的Raisi是国家的二号人物。他的去世正值整个中东地区紧张之际。几周前，伊朗对以色列发动了大规模无人机和导弹袭击，称这是对以色列在叙利亚的一个外交设施的袭击的报复，那次袭击造成几名伊朗官员死亡。CNN的Ivan Watson将向大家展示伊朗人民的反应以及该国的下一步举措。

伊朗正处于哀悼状态，纪念伊朗总统Ebrahim Raisi的意外去世。他与外交部长及其他七名官员和机组成员在直升机周日在该国西北部偏远山区坠毁时丧生。在搜救人员紧张寻找失踪总统的几小时内，伊朗政治体系中最有权力的人物、最高领袖Ayatollah Khamenei宣布政府稳定且强大。

在伊朗国内，对领导人突然去世的反应高度两极化。根据伊朗宪法，鲜为人知的副总统Mohammad Mokhber现已成为临时总统，为在50天内举行选举铺平了道路。

来自长期盟友如叙利亚以及俄罗斯的慰问信息纷纷涌入，俄罗斯对乌克兰城市发射伊朗Shahed无人机。同样公开哀悼Raisi去世的还有伊朗支持的武装组织，如也门的胡塞武装、哈马斯和黎巴嫩的真主党。与此同时，伊朗的宿敌以色列可能不会流太多眼泪。两国长期以来的影子战争上个月爆发为直接的针锋相对的远程打击。

伊朗如何处理这起致命的坠机事件可能会为未来的一个更大挑战奠定基础，那就是85岁的最高领袖的继任问题。
