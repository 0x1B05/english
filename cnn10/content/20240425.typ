Even though the bill has been signed #underline[in]to law, it doesn't mean TikTok would just disappear. The social media giant plans to #underline[*sue*] the U.S. government to block the law, claiming it's #underline[*unconstitutional* and] violate #strike[for the] #underline[free] speech.

TikTok is #underline[ready to fight.] They#underline['ll] go hard and *call on*, #underline[they'll say it's a] free speech #underline[issue]. But even so say it takes a year to possibly find #underline[someone] who wants to buy it.

So between the #underline[court fight] and #underline[the] extensions, it's unlikely anything going to happen very quickly.

So it could be up to a year before anything happens, but if ByteDance refuses to sell the TikTok or if the Chinese government steps in and says ByteDance cannot sell TikTok, then by January of next year, you might not be able to download or update TikTok app in United States. That means you could theoretically keep TikTok on your phone and keep using it but you won't be able to update it. So over time it #underline[would] probably get buggy, start to get #underline[*glitchy*] and likely stop working after a while.

嗨，阳光！希望你度过了一个充满感恩的星期四。感恩有助于保持心态积极。我是科伊·怀尔，这里是 CNN 十点新闻。

我们今天的节目以一条对许多人可能特别感兴趣的新闻开始，TikTok 可能离在美国被禁止又近了一步。美国总统Joe Biden签署了国会送交给他的一项法案，如果拥有该应用的公司在未来几个月内找不到新的买家，将有效地禁止这款社交媒体应用在美国的使用。为什么会发生这样的事情？因为许多美国领导人认为 TikTok 对美国国家安全构成威胁。这款应用由字节跳动拥有，是一家私营的中国公司。但在中国，威权政府经常把私营公司当作政府所有的企业。尽管这项法案已经签署成为法律，但这并不意味着 TikTok 会消失。这家社交媒体巨头计划起诉美国政府以阻止这项法律，声称这违反了宪法并侵犯了言论自由。

TikTok 已经准备好了战斗。他们会全力以赴，称这是一个言论自由的问题。但即使这样，也可能需要一年的时间才能找到愿意购买的人。然后，如果白宫看到有一些进展，他们甚至可以给他们90天的延期。所以在法庭上的争斗和延期之间，很可能不会有什么事情很快发生。

因此，可能要等到一年之后才会有任何进展，但如果字节跳动拒绝出售 TikTok，或者如果中国政府干预并表示字节跳动不能出售 TikTok，那么到明年一月，你可能就不能在美国下载或更新 TikTok 应用了。这意味着你理论上可以继续在手机上使用 TikTok，但无法更新。随着时间的推移，它可能会变得不稳定，开始出现故障，并且可能在一段时间后停止工作。

Hi, sunshine! Hope you are having a thankful Thursday. Gratitude is helpful to attitude. I'm Coy Wire, this is cnn 10.

Today's show begins with a news that many people may take considerable interest in, TikTok getting one step closer to being banned in the U.S. The American president Joe Biden has signed a bill that the Congress sent to him which would effectively ban the social media in the U.S. if the company who owned the app aren't able to find a new buyer. Why would this happen? Because many American leaders consider TikTok is a threat to the National Security. The app is owned by ByteDance, a privately owned company. But in China, a privately owned company is often regarded as government owned company by authoritarian government. Even though the bill has been signed into a law, it doesn't mean that TikTok will disappear. The social media giant plans to sue the American government, trying to block the law, claiming the law is unconstitutional and violate speech free.

TikTok is ready to fight. They will endeavor themselves, stating it's a issue on speech free. But it may takes one year to find one who are willing to buy it though. And then, if the White House sees some progress, they can offer a 90-day extension. So during the time of the court fight and extension, it won't happen quickly.

So, it takes a year to see any progress. But if ByteDance refuses to sell TikTok or the Chinese government interferes in and doesn't allow ByteDance to sell TikTok, then you wouldn't be able to download or update TikTok in America by January next year. And it means you could keep using TikTok on your phone theoretically but couldn't update the app. As time passed, it could become buggy, start to go wrong and could stop working then.
