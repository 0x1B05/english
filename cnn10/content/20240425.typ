== TikTok

We kick off today's show with some news could be #strike[an] #underline[of] particular interest to a lot of us, TikTok could be one step closer to being banned in the United States. President Joe Biden signing a bill#strike[,] sent to #underline[him by] Congress #strike[to] #underline[that would] effectively ban the social media app in America if the company that owns it doesn't find a new owner in the next few months. Why is this happening? Because many American leaders say TikTok is a threat to U.S. National Security. The #underline[app is owned] by ByteDance #underline[, a ]privately own#underline[ed] Chinese company. But in China, the authoritarian #strike[in] government #underline[often treats privately] owned companies like they are government owned. Even though the bill has been signed #underline[in]to law, it doesn't mean TikTok would just disappear. The social media giant plans to #underline[*sue*] the U.S. government to block the law, claiming it's #underline[*unconstitutional* and] violate #strike[for the] #underline[free] speech.

TikTok is #underline[ready to fight.] They#underline['ll] go hard and *call on*, #underline[they'll say it's a] free speech #underline[issue]. But even so say it takes a year to possibly find #underline[someone] who wants to buy it. And then maybe if the White House #underline[sees that there's some progress], they can even give #underline[them like] 90-day #underline[*extension*]. So between the #underline[court fight] and #underline[the] extensions, it's unlikely anything going to happen very quickly.

So it could be up to a year before anything happens, but if ByteDance refuses to sell the TikTok or if the Chinese government steps in and says ByteDance cannot sell TikTok, then by January of next year, you might not be able to download or update TikTok app in United States. That means you could theoretically keep TikTok on your phone and keep using it but you won't be able to update it. So over time it #underline[would] probably get buggy, start to get #underline[*glitchy*] and likely stop working after a while.

嗨，阳光！希望你度过了一个充满感恩的星期四。感恩有助于保持心态积极。我是科伊·怀尔，这里是 CNN 十点新闻。

我们今天的节目以一条对许多人可能特别感兴趣的新闻开始，TikTok 可能离在美国被禁止又近了一步。美国总统Joe Biden签署了国会送交给他的一项法案，如果拥有该应用的公司在未来几个月内找不到新的买家，将有效地禁止这款社交媒体应用在美国的使用。为什么会发生这样的事情？因为许多美国领导人认为 TikTok 对美国国家安全构成威胁。这款应用由字节跳动拥有，是一家私营的中国公司。但在中国，威权政府经常把私营公司当作政府所有的企业。尽管这项法案已经签署成为法律，但这并不意味着 TikTok 会消失。这家社交媒体巨头计划起诉美国政府以阻止这项法律，声称这违反了宪法并侵犯了言论自由。

TikTok 已经准备好了战斗。他们会全力以赴，称这是一个言论自由的问题。但即使这样，也可能需要一年的时间才能找到愿意购买的人。然后，如果白宫看到有一些进展，他们甚至可以给他们90天的延期。所以在法庭上的争斗和延期之间，很可能不会有什么事情很快发生。

因此，可能要等到一年之后才会有任何进展，但如果字节跳动拒绝出售 TikTok，或者如果中国政府干预并表示字节跳动不能出售 TikTok，那么到明年一月，你可能就不能在美国下载或更新 TikTok 应用了。这意味着你理论上可以继续在手机上使用 TikTok，但无法更新。随着时间的推移，它可能会变得不稳定，开始出现故障，并且可能在一段时间后停止工作。

Hi, sunshine! Hope you are having a #underline[thoroughly] thankful Thursday. Gratitude is helpful to attitude. I'm Coy Wire, this is cnn 10.

Today's show begins with #strike[a]#underline[some] news #strike[that many people may take considerable interest in] #underline[could be of particular interest to a lot of us], TikTok getting one step closer to being banned in the U.S. The American president Joe Biden has signed a bill that the Congress sent to him which would effectively ban the social media in the U.S. if the company who owned the app aren't able to find a new #strike[buyer] #underline[owner]. Why #strike[would] #underline[is] this happen#underline[ing]? Because many American leaders #strike[consider] #underline[say] TikTok is a threat to the National Security. The app is owned by ByteDance, a privately owned #underline[Chinese] company. But in China, #strike[a privately owned company is often regarded as government owned company by authoritarian government] #underline[the authoritarian government often treats privately owned companies like they are government owned]. Even though the bill has been signed into a law, it doesn't mean that TikTok #strike[will] #underline[would just] disappear. The social media giant plans to sue the American government, trying to block the law, claiming the law is unconstitutional and violate speech free.

TikTok is ready to fight. They will #strike[endeavor themselves] #underline[go hard and call on], stating it's a #underline[free speech]issue on speech free. But it may takes one year to find one who are willing to buy it though. And then, if the White House sees some progress, they can offer a 90-day extension. So during the time of the court fight and extension, it won't happen quickly.

So, it takes a year to see any progress. But if ByteDance refuses to sell TikTok or the Chinese government interferes in and doesn't allow ByteDance to sell TikTok, then you wouldn't be able to download or update TikTok in America by January next year. And it means you could keep using TikTok on your phone theoretically but couldn't update the app. As time passed, it could become buggy, start to go wrong and could stop working then.

Pro-Palestinian protests that started at U.S. Columbia University are now spreading to colleges in universities across the U.S. Fundamentally, students are protesting how their schools invest their endowments or large pools of money that colleges and universities usually acquire through donations. Pro-Palestinian student protesters want the school to divest or take money away from companies that are either Israeli or involved in Israel's war in Gaza. CNN's Isabel Rosales has more:

Growing protests, as student from Columbia University vowing to occupy school grounds until the university meets their demands. This, as calls for the resignation of the school's president Minouche Shafik, continue to get louder. Shafik under fire from both inside and outside the university and could face a censure vote from the university senate as early as tomorrow.

Shafik and other university officials are facing internal criticism that NYPD arrests and students suspensions allegedly violated tenets of "Academic Freedom" and "Free Expression on Campus". From Boston to Berkeley, there is a spotlight on how colleges are managing student outrage. Harvard Yard closed for a second day in a row, while at MIT, a Pro-Palestinian encampment stands firm in solidarity with other protesting students.

The growing unrest on college campuses causing concern and chaos as schools prepare for the graduation in the coming weeks.

Many students saying, they fear for their safety. While others say they're vehemently opposing all forms of oppression.

亲巴勒斯坦的抗议活动从美国哥伦比亚大学开始，现在正在扩散到全美各大高校。根本上，学生们抗议的是他们的学校如何对他们的捐赠基金或通过捐赠获得的大笔资金进行投资。亲巴勒斯坦的学生抗议者希望学校撤资，即将资金从以色列公司或与以色列在加沙的战争有关的公司撤出。CNN的Isabel Rosales带来了更多报道：

抗议活动日益增长，哥伦比亚大学的学生誓要占领校园，直到大学满足他们的要求。同时，要求学校校长Minouche Shafik辞职的呼声也越来越高。Shafik面临来自校内外的压力，最早可能在明天面临大学参议院的谴责投票。

Shafik和其他大学官员面临内部批评，指控纽约警察局逮捕和学生停学事件涉嫌违反“学术自由”和“校园言论自由”的原则。从波士顿到伯克利，各大高校如何应对学生的愤怒引起了广泛关注。哈佛大学校园连续第二天关闭，而在麻省理工学院，一个亲巴勒斯坦的营地坚守立场，声援其他抗议学生。

随着各校为即将到来的毕业季做准备，校园内日益增长的不安引发了担忧和混乱。

许多学生表示，他们担心自己的安全。还有一些学生表示，他们坚决反对一切形式的压迫。
