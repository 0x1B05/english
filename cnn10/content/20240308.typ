== International Women's Day

What's up lovely people, happy Friday! And happy International Women's day, we will start this #underline[March 8th] by putting this #strike[sparklight] #underline[spotlight] on two #strike[different making] #underline[difference-making] #strike[women's] #underline[women whose] lives and actions shine bright #underline[to] these day.

First up, #underline[civil rights pioneer Claudette Colvin] at her age of 15 in the year 1955, she #strike[was] refused to give up her seat to a whiter passenger on a bus in #underline[Montgomery, Alabama]. That was nine months before #strike[, where the ..]#underline[Rosa Parks famously] did the same#strike[, for] #underline[. For her act of] protest, Claudette was arrested and accused of #strike[a]  #strike[violating segregation]#underline[the city's *segregation*] #strike[grows] #underline[rules] and assaulting a police officer. She #strike[lead the ...]#underline[later *petitioned*] to clear her record and 66 years later her request was granted in 2021.

Claudette, who's now 84 years old, #underline[remained an unsung] hero of the #strike[ration] #underline[racial] justice #strike[moving] #underline[movement], until the book about her life by #underline[Philip Hoose]  #strike[one] #underline[won] the #strike[national book words for young people's literature] #underline[National Book Awards for Young People's Literature] in 2009.

Next, we *honor* the life of #underline[Kate Sheppard], an #underline[*activist*] who helped New Zealand become the first country in the world to allow women to vote back in 1893.

亲爱的朋友们，周五快乐！今天是国际妇女节，让我们开始这个三月八号，聚焦两位不同的女性，她们的生活和行动至今闪耀着光芒。

首先，我们来看看公民权利先驱Claudette Colvin。1955年，她15岁时在Alabama Montgomery的一辆公共汽车上，拒绝为一位白人乘客让座。这发生在Rosa Parks之后的九个月。由于她的抗议行为，Claudette被捕并被指控违反城市的种族隔离规定，以及袭击警察。她后来申请清除她的记录，66年后的2021年，她的请求获得了批准。

现年84岁的Claudette一直是种族公正运动中不为人知的英雄，直到2009年Philip Hoose写了一本书讲述她生平，获得了青少年文学国家图书奖。

接下来，我们向Kate Sheppard的生命致敬。她是一名活动家，帮助新西兰于1893年成为世界上第一个允许妇女投票的国家。原籍英国Liverpool，她20多岁时移居新西兰，并成为妇女基督教禁酒联盟的成员，该组织主张通过妇女选举权来反对酒精禁令。然而，凯特的活动远不止于此，她成为了新西兰妇女选举运动的领袖，为议会中的女性代表权以及女性不再穿紧身衣的自由而奋斗。她在新西兰和国外的活动激励了世界各地的妇女权利运动的崛起。

#strike[Dear friends] #underline[What's up lovely people], happy Firday. #strike[Today's] #underline[And happy] international Women's day, let's start this March 8th#strike[, focusing] #underline[by putting this sportlight] on two #strike[different] #underline[difference-making] women whose lives and actions still shine brightly these days.

First, let's head to the #strike[civilian] #underline[civil] rights pioneer Claudette Colvin. She refused to give #underline[up] #strike[a] #underline[her] seat to a whiter passenger on a bus at the age of her 15 in 1955. It happens 9 months after Rosa Parks did the same. Because of her #underline[act of] #strike[protesting] #underline[protest], Claudette was arrested and accused of #underline[the *citys's segregation rule*] and #strike[attacking] #underline[assaulting] a police officer. She later #strike[asked] #underline[petitioned] to clear her record, 66 years later, in 2021, her request was #strike[allowed] #underline[granted].

Claudette, who's been 84 years old, #underline[remained an unsung hero of the racial justice movement], util the book about her life written by Philip Hoose won the National Book Awards for Young People's Literature.

Next up, we honor the life of Kate Sheppard #strike[who's a] #underline[, an] activist#strike[, helping] #underline[who helped] New Zealand become the first country in the world#strike[that allows] #underline[to allow] women to vote back in 1893. #strike[She was] #underline[Originally] born in Liverpool, England, #strike[and] #underline[she] immigrated to New Zealand in her early 20s and became #underline[an activist as] a member of #underline[Women's Christian Temperance Union], which #strike[believes in opposing liquor prohibition through women's voting] #underline[advocated for women suffrage as a way to fight for liquor prohibition].

== Brain-computer Interfaces

Next up, we examined *cutting-edge* technology behind a human #strike[branch] #underline[brain chip] that can translate #strike[neuro] #underline[neural] activity into commands on a computer. You may remember Elon Musk announced about 5 weeks ago that a person received the implant from his company #underline[Neuralink] for the first time. But there are other companies like #underline[Synchron] who #strike[has] #underline[have] been implanting people in its *clinical trial* in the U.S. for years. CNN's #underline[Chief Medical] Correspandent, doctor #underline[Sanjay Gupta], goes behind the scenes with the #strike[focus] #underline[*folks* at Synchron] to learn how this #strike[grant breaking] #underline[groundbreaking] technology aims at changing lives for the better.

Up, down, left, right. Everything you're watching happen on this screen right now is being controlled only with Mark's thoughts.

So that#strike['s just a] #underline[just sent out a] health #strike[modification] #underline[notification].

He describes it #strike[is] #underline[as] #strike[constructing] #underline[constracting] and relaxing his brain: It takes concentration. It's #underline[a] pretty involve process. It's one I don't take #strike[likely] #underline[lightly]. 

This's all been pretty sudden for Mark. He was dignosed with #underline[ALS] in 2021. Mark has #underline[since] lost control of his hands and arms. He #underline[would] likely #strike[loses] #underline[lose] his voice. Markd didn't hesitate to sign #underline[a clinical] trial to have this #strike[plays] #underline[placed] in his brain. It's called #underline[a *stentrode*]. 

#strike[I mean] #underline[To me,] it gives me opportunities to continue to do things that I'm able to do now#strike[. Just about to think] #underline[just by thinking] about it. In the world #underline[of] the brain-computer interfaces or BCIs, _it is still early days_. In fact, up #strike[to] #underline[until] recently, it #strike[almost let] #underline[mostly led to] monkeys being able to play pong. But Synchron was one of the first companies in the world to get the FDA approval for human trials, and Mark is one of those first humans. 

It's all the #strike[brain trial] #underline[brainchild of] this man, doctor Tom Oxley. For people who have got #underline[*paralysis* or *motor impairment*,] but they have that part of brain still working, then if you can put a device in, get the information, get it out of the brain. Then you can turn what previouly was the signal controlling your body into a signal that controls the digital devices. The #underline[*stentrode* is the device that Oxley and his team at Synchron] created. It's #underline[a *cage* of thin] wired *mesh* with #strike[electron centrals] #underline[electrode sensors] that can detect #strike[a lectural] #underline[the electrical] brain activity#strike[. T] #underline[, t]ranslate that activity and then transmit it to devices such as a phone or a computer. 

It's amazing. That's all I could say.

And just like a #strike[stand] #underline[*stent*], it doesn't require open brain surgery. Instead it's able to travel through the body's natural network veins, #underline[and sit in a major vein] right in the middle of the brain. Our brain has millions of *neurons* #underline[firing] electrical #underline[impluses] that control our movements, everything from shaking hands to taking a step. Each #underline[and every] one of those actions is associated with a specific electrical signature. The *stentrode* #strike[, watch] #underline[which] again, sets right here around #underline[that area] of the brain responsible for movement, learns to recognize those specific #underline[electrical] patterns, and #strike[eventually] #underline[essentially] creates your own personalized dictionary movement. It's a hope for patients in the future, and a chance for Mark to continue living #strike[the] #underline[a] full life now.

So that just sent out a health notification.

He describes it as constracting and relaxing his brain: It takes concentration. It's a pretty involve process. It's one I don't take lightly.

This's all been pretty sudden for Mark. He was dignosed with ALS in 2021. Mark has since lost control of his hands and arms. He would likely lose his voice. Markd didn't hesitate to sign a clinical trial to have this placed in his brain. It's called a stentrode.

接下来，我们将研究一种人脑芯片的前沿技术，它可以将神经活动转化为计算机上的指令。你可能还记得Elon Musk大约五周前宣布，有人首次接受了他的公司Neuralink的植入器。但是像Synchron这样的其他公司已经在美国进行临床试验多年了。CNN的首席医学记者、医生Sanjay Gupta博士与Synchron的工作人员一起走进幕后，了解这项开创性技术如何旨在改善生活。

上、下、左、右。你现在在屏幕上看到的一切都是仅凭马克的想法控制的。

刚才它发送了一条健康通知。

他描述它为收缩和放松他的大脑：这需要集中注意力。这是一个相当复杂的过程。我不敢轻视。

对于马克来说，这一切都是相当突然的。他在2021年被诊断患有肌萎缩侧索硬化症。自那以后，马克已经失去了对手和胳膊的控制。他可能还会失去声音。马克毫不犹豫地签署了一项临床试验，将这个装置植入他的大脑。它被称为stentrode。

对我来说，它给了我继续做现在能做的事情的机会，只需想一想。在脑-计算机接口或BCI的世界中，现在仍然是早期阶段。事实上，直到最近，它大多是让猴子能够玩乒乓球。但是Synchron是世界上第一批获得FDA批准进行人体试验的公司之一，而马克就是其中的一位试验者。

汤姆·奥克斯利博士，这一切都是这个人的创意。对于那些瘫痪或运动障碍的人来说，他们的大脑仍在工作，如果你能放置一个设备，获取信息，从大脑中获取信息。然后，您可以将以前控制身体的信号转换为控制数字设备的信号。stentrode是Oxley和他在Synchron团队创造的设备。它是由细丝网笼和电极传感器组成的，可以检测电脑活动，将该活动转换然后将其传输到诸如手机或计算机之类的设备。

太神奇了。这就是我能说的。

就像支架一样，它不需要开颅手术。相反，它能够穿过身体的自然静脉网络，并位于大脑中间的一条主要静脉中。我们的大脑有数百万个神经元发射控制我们的运动的电冲动，从握手到迈步的一切。每一个行动都与特定的电信号相关联。stentrode再次设置在负责运动的大脑区域周围，学会识别这些特定的电信号模式，从而创建自己的个性化运动字典。这对未来的患者是一种希望，也是马克继续过上充实生活的机会。
