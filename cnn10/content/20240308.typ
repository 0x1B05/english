亲爱的朋友们，周五快乐！今天是国际妇女节，让我们开始这个三月八号，聚焦两位不同的女性，她们的生活和行动至今闪耀着光芒。

首先，我们来看看公民权利先驱Claudette Colvin。1955年，她15岁时在Alabama Montgomery的一辆公共汽车上，拒绝为一位白人乘客让座。这发生在Rosa Parks之后的九个月。由于她的抗议行为，Claudette被捕并被指控违反城市的种族隔离规定，以及袭击警察。她后来申请清除她的记录，66年后的2021年，她的请求获得了批准。

现年84岁的Claudette一直是种族公正运动中不为人知的英雄，直到2009年Philip Hoose写了一本书讲述她生平，获得了青少年文学国家图书奖。

接下来，我们向Kate Sheppard的生命致敬。她是一名活动家，帮助新西兰于1893年成为世界上第一个允许妇女投票的国家。原籍英国Liverpool，她20多岁时移居新西兰，并成为妇女基督教禁酒联盟的成员，该组织主张通过妇女选举权来反对酒精禁令。然而，凯特的活动远不止于此，她成为了新西兰妇女选举运动的领袖，为议会中的女性代表权以及女性不再穿紧身衣的自由而奋斗。她在新西兰和国外的活动激励了世界各地的妇女权利运动的崛起。
