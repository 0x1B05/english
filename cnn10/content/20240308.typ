== International Women's Day

What's up lovely people, happy Friday! And happy International Women's day, we will start this #underline[March 8th] by putting this #strike[sparklight] #underline[spotlight] on two #strike[different making] #underline[difference-making] #strike[women's] #underline[women whose] lives and actions shine bright #underline[to] these day.

First up, #underline[civil rights pioneer Claudette Colvin] at her age of 15 in the year 1955, she #strike[was] refused to give up her seat to a whiter passenger on a bus in #underline[Montgomery, Alabama]. That was nine months before #strike[, where the ..]#underline[Rosa Parks famously] did the same#strike[, for] #underline[. For her act of] protest, Claudette was arrested and accused of #strike[a]  #strike[violating segregation]#underline[the city's *segregation*] #strike[grows] #underline[rules] and assaulting a police officer. She #strike[lead the ...]#underline[later *petitioned*] to clear her record and 66 years later her request was granted in 2021.

Claudette, who's now 84 years old, #underline[remained an unsung] hero of the #strike[ration] #underline[racial] justice #strike[moving] #underline[movement], until the book about her life by #underline[Philip Hoose]  #strike[one] #underline[won] the #strike[national book words for young people's literature] #underline[National Book Awards for Young People's Literature] in 2009.

Next, we *honor* the life of #underline[Kate Sheppard], an #underline[*activist*] who helped New Zealand become the first country in the world to allow women to vote back in 1893.

What's up lovely people, happy Friday! And happy International Women's day, we will start this March 8th by putting this spotlight on two difference-making women whose lives and actions shine bright to these day.

First up, civil rights pioneer Claudette Colvin at her age of 15 in the year 1955, she refused to give up her seat to a whiter passenger on a bus in Montgomery, Alabama. That was nine months before Rosa Parks famously did the same . For her act of protest, Claudette was arrested and accused of the city's segregation rules and assaulting a police officer.

Claudette, who's now 84 years old, remained an unsung hero of the racial justice movement, until the book about her life by Philip Hoose won the National Book Awards for Young People's Literature in 2009.

Next, we honor the life of Kate Sheppard, an activist who helped New Zealand become the first country in the world to allow women to vote back in 1893. Originally born in Liverpool, England, she immigrated to New Zealand in her early 20s and became an activist as a member of Women's Christian Temperance Union, which advocated for women suffrage as a way to fight for liquor prohibition. Kate, however, took her activism way beyond that, become a leader in New Zealand suffrage movement, fighting for issues ranging from representation in Parliament to freedom from wearing the corset. Her activism work in New Zealand and abroad inspired women's rights movement around the world, rise up.

亲爱的朋友们，周五快乐！今天是国际妇女节，让我们开始这个三月八号，聚焦两位不同的女性，她们的生活和行动至今闪耀着光芒。

首先，我们来看看公民权利先驱Claudette Colvin。1955年，她15岁时在Alabama Montgomery的一辆公共汽车上，拒绝为一位白人乘客让座。这发生在Rosa Parks之后的九个月。由于她的抗议行为，Claudette被捕并被指控违反城市的种族隔离规定，以及袭击警察。她后来申请清除她的记录，66年后的2021年，她的请求获得了批准。

现年84岁的Claudette一直是种族公正运动中不为人知的英雄，直到2009年Philip Hoose写了一本书讲述她生平，获得了青少年文学国家图书奖。

接下来，我们向Kate Sheppard的生命致敬。她是一名活动家，帮助新西兰于1893年成为世界上第一个允许妇女投票的国家。原籍英国Liverpool，她20多岁时移居新西兰，并成为妇女基督教禁酒联盟的成员，该组织主张通过妇女选举权来反对酒精禁令。然而，凯特的活动远不止于此，她成为了新西兰妇女选举运动的领袖，为议会中的女性代表权以及女性不再穿紧身衣的自由而奋斗。她在新西兰和国外的活动激励了世界各地的妇女权利运动的崛起。

#strike[Dear friends] #underline[What's up lovely people], happy Firday. #strike[Today's] #underline[And happy] international Women's day, let's start this March 8th#strike[, focusing] #underline[by putting this sportlight] on two #strike[different] #underline[difference-making] women whose lives and actions still shine brightly these days.

First, let's head to the #strike[civilian] #underline[civil] rights pioneer Claudette Colvin. She refused to give #underline[up] #strike[a] #underline[her] seat to a whiter passenger on a bus at the age of her 15 in 1955. It happens 9 months after Rosa Parks did the same. Because of her #underline[act of] #strike[protesting] #underline[protest], Claudette was arrested and accused of #underline[the *citys's segregation rule*] and #strike[attacking] #underline[assaulting] a police officer. She later #strike[asked] #underline[petitioned] to clear her record, 66 years later, in 2021, her request was #strike[allowed] #underline[granted].

Claudette, who's been 84 years old, #underline[remained an unsung hero of the racial justice movement], until the book about her life written by Philip Hoose won the National Book Awards for Young People's Literature.

Next up, we honor the life of Kate Sheppard #strike[who's a] #underline[, an] activist#strike[, helping] #underline[who helped] New Zealand become the first country in the world#strike[that allows] #underline[to allow] women to vote back in 1893. #strike[She was] #underline[Originally] born in Liverpool, England, #strike[and] #underline[she] immigrated to New Zealand in her early 20s and became #underline[an activist as] a member of #underline[Women's Christian Temperance Union], which #strike[believes in opposing liquor prohibition through women's voting] #underline[advocated for women suffrage as a way to fight for liquor prohibition]. However #strike[the action Kate has done is far more than this] #underline[Kate, however, *took* her activism way beyond that], #strike[she then] became the leader #strike[of the New Zealand women voting movement] #underline[in New Zealand suffrage movement], fighting for #strike[the rights of women's respresent and the freedom of no ... in the meeting] #underline[issues ranging form representation in Parliament to freedom from wearing the corset]. #strike[The activity she led] #underline[Her activism work in New Zealand and abroad] inspired #strike[women] #underline[women's rights] movements across the world#underline[, rise up].

== Brain-computer Interfaces

Next up, we examined *cutting-edge* technology behind a human #strike[branch] #underline[brain chip] that can translate #strike[neuro] #underline[neural] activity into commands on a computer. You may remember Elon Musk announced about 5 weeks ago that a person received the implant from his company #underline[Neuralink] for the first time. But there are other companies like #underline[Synchron] who #strike[has] #underline[have] been implanting people in its *clinical trial* in the U.S. for years. CNN's #underline[Chief Medical] Correspandent, doctor #underline[Sanjay Gupta], goes behind the scenes with the #strike[focus] #underline[*folks* at Synchron] to learn how this #strike[grant breaking] #underline[groundbreaking] technology aims at changing lives for the better.

Up, down, left, right. Everything you're watching happen on this screen right now is being controlled only with Mark's thoughts.

So that#strike['s just a] #underline[just sent out a] health #strike[modification] #underline[notification].

He describes it #strike[is] #underline[as] #strike[constructing] #underline[contracting] and relaxing his brain: It takes concentration. It's #underline[a] pretty involved process. It's one I don't take #strike[likely] #underline[lightly]. 

This's all been pretty sudden for Mark. He was diagnosed with #underline[ALS] in 2021. Mark has #underline[since] lost control of his hands and arms. He #underline[would] likely #strike[loses] #underline[lose] his voice. Markd didn't hesitate to sign #underline[a clinical] trial to have this #strike[plays] #underline[placed] in his brain. It's called #underline[a *stentrode*]. 

#strike[I mean] #underline[To me,] it gives me opportunities to continue to do things that I'm able to do now#strike[. Just about to think] #underline[just by thinking] about it. In the world #underline[of] the brain-computer interfaces or BCIs, _it is still early days_. In fact, up #strike[to] #underline[until] recently, it #strike[almost let] #underline[mostly led to] monkeys being able to play pong. But Synchron was one of the first companies in the world to get the FDA approval for human trials, and Mark is one of those first humans. 

It's all the #strike[brain trial] #underline[brainchild of] this man, doctor Tom Oxley. For people who have got #underline[*paralysis* or *motor impairment*,] but they have that part of brain still working, then if you can put a device in, get the information, get it out of the brain. Then you can turn what previously was the signal controlling your body into a signal that controls the digital devices. The #underline[*stentrode* is the device that Oxley and his team at Synchron] created. It's #underline[a *cage* of thin] wired *mesh* with #strike[electron centrals] #underline[electrode sensors] that can detect #strike[a lectural] #underline[the electrical] brain activity#strike[. T] #underline[, t]ranslate that activity and then transmit it to devices such as a phone or a computer. 

It's amazing. That's all I could say.

And just like a #strike[stand] #underline[*stent*], it doesn't require open brain surgery. Instead it's able to travel through the body's natural network veins, #underline[and sit in a major vein] right in the middle of the brain. Our brain has millions of *neurons* #underline[firing] electrical #underline[impulses] that control our movements, everything from shaking hands to taking a step. Each #underline[and every] one of those actions is associated with a specific electrical signature. The *stentrode* #strike[, watch] #underline[which] again, sets right here around #underline[that area] of the brain responsible for movement, learns to recognize those specific #underline[electrical] patterns, and #strike[eventually] #underline[essentially] creates your own personalized dictionary of movement. It's a hope for patients in the future, and a chance for Mark to continue living #strike[the] #underline[a] full life now.

接下来，我们将研究人脑芯片背后的一项前沿技术，它可以将神经活动转化为计算机上的指令。你可能还记得Elon Musk大约五周前宣布，有人首次接受了他的公司Neuralink的植入器。但是像Synchron这样的其他公司已经在美国进行临床试验多年了。CNN的首席医学记者、医生Sanjay Gupta博士与Synchron的工作人员一起走进幕后，了解这项开创性技术如何旨在改善生活。

上、下、左、右。你现在在屏幕上看到的一切都是仅凭Mark的想法控制的。

刚才它发送了一条健康通知。

他描述它为收缩和放松他的大脑：这需要集中注意力。这是一个相当复杂的过程。我不敢轻视。

对于马克来说，这一切都是相当突然的。他在2021年被诊断患有肌萎缩侧索硬化症。自那以后，马克已经失去了对手和胳膊的控制。他可能还会失去声音。马克毫不犹豫地签署了一项临床试验，将这个装置植入他的大脑。它被称为stentrode。

对我来说，它给了我继续做现在能做的事情的机会，只需想一想。在脑-计算机接口或BCI的世界中，现在仍然是早期阶段。事实上，直到最近，它大多是让猴子能够玩乒乓球。但是Synchron是世界上第一批获得FDA批准进行人体试验的公司之一，而马克就是其中的一位试验者。

汤姆·奥克斯利博士，这一切都是这个人的创意。对于那些瘫痪或运动障碍的人来说，他们的大脑仍在工作，如果你能放置一个设备，获取信息，从大脑中获取信息。然后，您可以将以前控制身体的信号转换为控制数字设备的信号。stentrode是Oxley和他在Synchron团队创造的设备。它是由细丝网笼和电极传感器组成的，可以检测电脑活动，将该活动转换然后将其传输到诸如手机或计算机之类的设备。

太神奇了。这就是我能说的。

就像支架一样，它不需要开颅手术。相反，它能够穿过身体的自然静脉网络，并位于大脑中间的一条主要静脉中。我们的大脑有数百万个神经元发射控制我们的运动的电冲动，从握手到迈步的一切。每一个行动都与特定的电信号相关联。stentrode再次设置在负责运动的大脑区域周围，学习识别这些特定的电信号模式，从而创建自己的个性化运动字典。这对未来的患者是一种希望，也是马克继续过上充实生活的机会。

To Mark, all happened suddenly. He was diagnosed #underline[with ALS in 2021] Since then, Mark had lost the control of his hands and arms. He could lose his void then. Mark signed a clinical trial without hesitation, #strike[loading] #underline[placing] this device called stentrode into his brain.

To me, it gives me an opportunity to do things that I am #strike[doing] #underline[able to do now] just by #strike[thoughts] #underline[thinking].

美国总统乔·拜登昨晚发表了他的国情咨文演讲，这是一个高风险的时刻，他正在准备在11月的大选中可能再次面对前总统唐纳德·特朗普的挑战。本周，特朗普和拜登分别在各自的超级星期二竞选中占据主导地位。而两位候选人的党内竞争对手——共和党方面的前联合国大使尼基·黑利和民主党方面的众议员迪恩·菲利普斯——都已结束了他们的竞选活动。

我们周一会展示一些拜登总统演讲的关键点，并分析两党对这次国情咨文的反应，但今天还有一些其他值得关注的政治新闻，美国国会本周避免了部分政府停摆，同意继续暂时资助政府，直到他们能够就个别支出协议达成投票，也就是所谓的拨款法案。民主党和共和党的高层已经就各个政府机构的六项资助法案达成一致，并正在努力在3月22日之前就另外六项达成协议。这是自2018年以来，国会首次未通过将所有拨款法案捆绑成一项协议来资助政府。

接下来，我们要说的是有史以来观测到的最古老的死亡星系。这是由James Webb太空望远镜发现的。天文学家和研究人员表示，这个星系在宇宙年龄仅有7亿年的时候就存在了，而现在宇宙年龄已经约为138亿年了。

那么，什么是死亡星系呢？实质上，它是一个不再具有形成新恒星能力的星系，因为没有足够的气体来形成它们。导致气体消失或消散的一些因素包括超大质量黑洞、恒星之间的激烈相互作用，以及新恒星在出生时消耗了所有剩余的气体。观测到这个新发现的死亡星系的天文学家和研究人员感到困惑，他们仍在努力揭示那里的恒星130亿年前快速生存和早逝的原因。

The astronomers and researchers says, the galaxy existed  when the #underline[*universe*] was only about 700 million years #underline[into its current age of about] 13.8 billion years.

So what is a dead galaxy? Actually, it is #underline[essentially] a galaxy that #strike[is unable to] #underline[no longer has the ability to] form new stars for the shortage of gas #underline[that's needed to create them]. Some factors causing the gas disappear or *dissipate* #strike[include] #underline[are] super massive black holes,#strike[interacting violently among stars]#underline[stars violently interacting] and #strike[all remained gas being consumed when a new star was born] #underline[new stars consuming all the remaining gas when they're born]. The astronomers and researchers #strike[who are] observing this #strike[new] #underline[newly] discovered dead galaxy #strike[feel] #underline[have left] puzzled, still trying to uncover the reason why stars there #strike[over 13 billion years ago] led such a short life and died early #underline[more than 13 billion years ago].
