== Fast-Food Workers Pay Raise

We start by taking #strike[news in] #underline[you out to] California, where many fast food workers just got a pay #underline[*raise*]#strike[, that] #underline[That's] because of the new law that #strike[when it is to affect] #underline[*went into effect*] on Monday #strike[when they] #underline[, one that] requires all fast food restaurants to pay their employees at least 20 dollars per hour. There are more half #strike[the] #underline[a] million fast food workers in California and many of them are#underline[n't] teenagers working in a#underline[n] after-school job. There are #underline[adults] , looking #underline[to keep a roof] over their heads, and food on their tables. And just this week, many of them just got 25% pay #strike[bomb] #underline[*bump*]. But not everyone is ready to order a happy meal after hearing this news. Many of these chain restaurants #strike[do not own] #underline[they're not owned] by the #underline[larger corporation,] they are owned by #underline[*franchisees*]. So they are more like small businesses, and #underline[these franchise store] owners, they are worried that the #strike[increasing] #underline[increase in] pay would make it too expensive to run their business, meaning they will have to *lay some people off* or stop plans to open new stores or even close some of their existing stores. But some researchers are questioning those fear around pay increases. They *state* over the past decade, California doubled its minimal #underline[*wage*], ending up at the current 16 dollars per hour. And during that time, the data shows that the #strike[increasing] #underline[increase in] pay did not lead to a lot of #strike[layout] #underline[*layoffs*] or #strike[slow down] #underline[a *slowdown*] in the pace of hiring. However, companies like Jack in the Box Starbucks, McDonald's and Chipotle say, they're going to raise prices in the State that already one of the most expensive places to live in the country.

大家好，让我们在这美好的星期二里精神饱满地开始一天，向所有辛勤工作、传授知识、激励我们的老师们致以崇高的敬意。所以一定要跟你的老师握手、击掌、拳头碰一下，让他们知道“我看到你了”。我是科伊，这里是CNN10，最精彩的10分钟新闻。振作起来吧！

首先，我们来到了加利福尼亚，那里的许多快餐工人刚刚获得了加薪。这是因为周一生效的新法律要求所有快餐店至少支付员工每小时20美元的工资。加利福尼亚有超过50万的快餐工人，其中许多并不是青少年在课后打工。他们是成年人，努力维持家庭生计(有家住，有饭吃)。而就在这一周，许多人的工资刚刚涨了25%。但并非每个人都因这个消息而感到开心。许多连锁餐厅并非由大公司所有，而是由加盟店经营。因此，它们更像是小型企业，而这些加盟店的业主们担心工资增加会使经营成本过高，意味着他们可能不得不裁员、取消开设新店的计划，甚至关闭一些现有店铺。但一些研究人员质疑了关于工资增加的这些担忧。他们指出，在过去的十年里，加利福尼亚的最低工资翻了一番，最终达到了当前的每小时16美元。而在此期间，数据显示，工资增加并没有导致大量裁员或招聘速度放缓。然而，像杰克快餐、星巴克、麦当劳和Chipotle这样的公司表示，它们将在这个已经是全美生活成本最高的州提高价格。

== Patapsco River Francis Scott Key Bridge

All right, next we take you out onto the Patapsco River to see the #underline[*remnants*] of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. As you may remember, last Tuesday in the early morning hour#underline[s], #strike[the ferry] #underline[a *freight*] ship crashed into a *pillar* of the *famed* bridge, causing it to collapse. Official#underline[s] said that the group of the six men#strike[, walking in over nine shift, fixing ... holes] #underline[working an overnight *shift* fixing potholes], died when it collapsed.

So you can see we have #strike[everybody] #underline[been able to get] extremely up close to the #underline[*wreckage*] of the Dali and #underline[we're starting to really get an] appreciation #strike[on the]#underline[and a] sense of just how massive this job is going to be.

But as we are sitting here, you #strike[know] now finally being able to see it and get up close to it, you really just get the sense of the #underline[*enormity*] of the job at hand.

好的，接下来我们带你到Baltimore的Patapsco河上，看看Francis Scott Key Bridge的残骸。你可能还记得，就在上周二清晨，一艘货船撞上了这座著名桥梁的桥墩，导致其倒塌。官员们表示，在倒塌时有六名夜班修补坑洞的工人死亡。Gloria Pazmino会给大家带来更多关于Baltimore市接下来的计划：

你可以看到我们已经能够非常近距离地接触Dali的残骸，我们开始真正意识到这项工作将会有多庞大。你们看到的是4000吨的钢铁和混凝土压在船头上。这将是整个行动中最复杂的部分，清理所有的残骸并将其从船上取下，以便他们开始清理工作。然后还有潜藏在水下的所有东西，那些我们看不见的部分，水中还有更多的金属、混凝土和碎片。这一点至关重要，因为他们必须确保这对于潜水员是安全的，他们的任务是重新进入水中并继续搜索，试图找回那些失踪者的尸体。但是当我们坐在这里，现在终于能够看到并接近它时，你真的能感受到手头工作的巨大。但是这里的所有官员都告诉我们，他们有信心能够完成这项任务。他们正在共同努力，拥有所有必要的技术，他们正在逐步进行，采取一种细致入微的方法，确保他们做对了，并最终可以重新开放港口，开始重建，这对Baltimore市来说是重要的象征。Baltimore市和Maryland州可以得到清理。这里的人们可以开始恢复正常生活。我是Gloria Pazmino，CNN报道。

== Wolf

Owooooo, sorry, just #strike[get in reintroduce ] #underline[getting reintroduced to] my inner wolf. That's a lot like what's happening in Colorado, where people vote#underline[d] to reintroduce wolves back to their state. That's the first time ever in the country's history that the state has voted on this kind of #underline[*ballot*] *initiative*. But as Lucy Kafanov shows us, after the vote passed by #underline[*a slim margin*, some folks in the more rural parts of the state weren't exactly *howling* with joy].

Humans adapting with wolves is going to be the biggest #underline[*obstacle*] we're going to be dealing with. After being nearly #underline[*eradicated*] from Colorado about 80 years ago, wolves are officially back in the state thanks to the first ever #strike[vote mended we introduction... wolves danger] #underline[*voter-mandated* reintroduction of *endangered* wolves] in U.S. history. These wolves#strike[ capture the] #underline[, captured in Oregon,]  will set free in Colorado's #underline[*wilderness*] last December.

"You're hungry. #strike[And] #underline[I] never thought #strike[to] #underline[I'd] be able to be so close to a wolf." 

"She's a very special #underline[*ambassador*]."

Kelly Murphy, the Animal Care Supervisor at Colorado Wolf & Wildlife center, is one of the advocates who's #strike[helping] #underline[helped] bring wolves back to the state.

"Obviously, this is not #underline[an *interaction* we'd ever have in the wild.]"

"If you see a wolf in #strike[a] #underline[the] wild, #strike[you're advised] #underline[our advice] to take a picture and consider yourself lucky because #strike[this] #underline[it] is not probably never gonna happen again."

Some 2 million gray wolves #strike[ran] #underline[once roamed] freely throughout #strike[the northern] #underline[North] America. But when European #underline[*settlers*] arrived, they brought their old#underline[-world *myths*] and #underline[*hatred* of] #strike[the] wolves with them. #strike[But in] #underline[By the] 1940s, wolves were nearly wiped out.

"There are so many #underline[*myths* and *misconceptions*] that are surrounding wolves. Sometimes it's difficult to understand they're not exactly true."

As an apex #strike[predictor,] #underline[*predator* at] the top of the food chain, they #strike[hope] #underline[help] keep certain animal population#underline[s] #strike[and] #underline[in] check#underline[,] which in turn helps plants, trees and other wildlife #underline[*thrive*].

"They're critical to maintaining the balance of our ecosystems, and that means that #underline[it's a more productive] landscape for ranchers to also #underline[*graze* their] cattle"

"So what #strike[do wolves] #underline[did the wolf] do to this specific cow?"
"So he got #underline[a hold of her by throat and then he got a hold of her by the hind] leg. #underline[It's healed] a lot."

Don Gittleson #underline[was *fending* off wolf *incursions* on his ranch in northern Colorado long before the ballot initiative.]

"#underline[We've had] wolves here for several years."

They #strike[may] #underline[have been] coming from the neighbor in Wyoming, which reintroduced wolves in the 90s.

"To me, this is my home. To them, this is their home. And they're not just gonna leave."

"See these marks in the snow here?"

"Are those wolf tracks?"

"That's the last time they came through."

In Colorado, the wolf #underline[re]introduction proposition barely passed with most #underline[of the votes in favor of] #underline[re]introduction coming from #strike[open]#underline[*urban*] areas like Denver and Boulder.

"People have very strong opinions about wolves. And #strike[that] #underline[it] doesn't matter what side they are on."

But here in the #strike[world] #underline[*rural Colorado*], there's no confusing which side they're on. #strike[They] #underline[The State] compensate#underline[s] ranchers for #strike[life] #underline[*livestock*] attacks. But because #strike[of] #underline[it's illegal to hunt wolves] in Colorado, Don has to get creative using #underline[*donkeys*] ("They bite, and they bite hard.") longhorns and shooting blanks. #strike[as we're fancing.] #underline[As for fencing?]

"It's a pretty big place to put #strike[the] #underline[a] fence around."

"Yep, #underline[a foot chain link] fence to keep the wolves out. I have #underline[*moose*]. I have #underline[*mule deer*] #strike[here]. I have #underline[*elk* and I have *antelope* that] cross this country to migrate back and forth. And I would absolutely stop them from doing that. And I #strike[will not] #underline[am not willing to do that.] "

"You care about #underline[this landscape]"

"So you don't #strike[these] #underline[manage] things #strike[pieces and time]#underline[one species at a time.]."

We don't wanna just leave it to the ranchers to deal with that on their own. There are a lot of organizations #strike[like] #underline[and] NGOs that are willing to help #underline[implement those non-lethal] measures because at the end of the day, ranchers #underline[and wolf advocates] the same thing. We all want clean air, clean spaces and #strike[how] #underline[healthy] environment #strike[in] #underline[and] ecosystem. And I think that wolves are #strike[the] #underline[a] very key element #strike[to make] #underline[into making] that happen.

哦呜~~抱歉，刚刚释放了一下我的内心狼。这有点像科罗拉多正在发生的事情，那里的人们投票决定重新引入狼到他们的州。这是该国历史上州首次就这类选票倡议进行投票。但正如Lucy Kafanov向我们展示的，投票结果勉强通过后，该州更农村地区的一些人并没有欢呼雀跃。

人类适应与狼共存将是我们要面对的最大障碍。大约80年前，狼在科罗拉多几乎被根除，现在它们正式回归这个州，得益于美国历史上首次由选民强制重新引入濒危狼种的投票倡议。这些狼是从俄勒冈州捕获的，去年12月被释放到科罗拉多的荒野中。

“你饿了。我从未想过我能这么接近一只狼。”

“她是一位非常特别的大使。”

凯利·墨菲（Kelly Murphy）是科罗拉多狼与野生动物中心的动物护理主管，她是帮助狼重新回到该州的倡导者之一。

“显然，这不是我们在野外会有的互动。”

“如果你在野外看到一只狼，我们的建议是拍照并认为自己很幸运，因为这可能再也不会发生了。”

曾经有大约200万只灰狼在北美自由地漫游。但当欧洲移民到来时，他们把他们的古老神话和对狼的仇恨带到了这里。到了20世纪40年代，狼几乎被消灭殆尽。

“有很多关于狼的神话和误解。有时候很难理解它们并不完全正确。”

作为食物链顶端的顶级捕食者，它们帮助控制某些动物群体的数量，从而帮助植物、树木和其他野生动物茁壮成长。

“它们对于维护我们生态系统的平衡至关重要，这意味着对牧场主来说，这是一个更具生产力的景观。”

“那狼对这头特定的牛做了什么？”
“所以它用嘴咬住她的喉咙，然后用后腿咬住她。它已经好了很多。”

唐·吉特尔森（Don Gittleson）在投票倡议之前就在科罗拉多北部的牧场上抵御狼的侵入。

“我们这里已经有狼好几年了。”

它们是从邻近的怀俄明州来的，怀俄明州在90年代重新引入了狼。

“对我来说，这是我的家。对它们来说，这也是它们的家。它们不会就这样离开。”

“看到这里的雪上有这些痕迹吗？”
“那是狼的踪迹吗？”
“这是它们上次经过的痕迹。”

在科罗拉多，狼重新引入的提案几乎只在像丹佛和博尔德这样的城市地区获得了大部分赞成票。

“人们对狼有很强烈的意见。无论他们站在哪一边。”

但在这个农村的科罗拉多州，他们的立场是明确的。州政府为农场主因牲畜被攻击而进行补偿。但由于在科罗拉多州狩猎狼是非法的，唐必须变着法子使用驴子（“它们咬得很狠。”）、长角牛和发射空弹。至于围栏？

“在这么大的地方放一个围栏？”

“是的，一尺高的铁丝网围栏来阻止狼。我这里有驼鹿、白尾鹿、麋鹿和羚羊，它们在这片地方来回迁徙。我绝对不会阻止它们这么做。”

“你关心这片土地。”

“所以你不能仅仅针对一个物种进行管理。”

我们不想让农场主自己应对这些问题。有许多组织和非政府组织愿意帮助实施这些非致命性的措施，因为归根结底，农场主和狼的倡导者都想要清洁的空气、清洁的空间和健康的环境和生态系统。我认为狼是实现这一目标的关键因素之一。

Owooooo, sorry, I #underline[was] just #underline[getting] reintroduced #underline[to] my inner wolf. #strike[This is] #underline[That's a lot] like what is happening in Colorado, where people vote#underline[d] to reintroduce wolves #underline[back] to their state. This is the first time #strike[people vote in this kind of initiative in the country] #underline[*ever* in the coutry's history that the state has voted on this kind of ballot initiative]. But as Lucy Kafanov showed us, after #strike[passing the initiative] #underline[the vote passed by a slim margin], #strike[the rural region in that state don't howl happily]#underline[some *folks* in the more rural parts of the state weren't exactly howling with joy].

#strike[The largest barrier we are confronting will be people's coexisting with wolves] #underline[Humans adapting with wolves is going to be the biggest obstacle we're going to be dealing with]. #strike[About 80 years ago, wolf was even wiped out in Colorado and now they had been reintroduced in this state officially thanks to the initiative people forced to vote to reintroduce the endanger wolf for the first time in U.S. history.]#underline[After being nearly eradicated from Colorado about 80 years ago, wolves are officially back in the state thanks to the first ever voter-mandated reintroduction of endangered wolves in U.S. history.] These wolves were captured #underline[in Oregon]  and had been #strike[released to] #underline[set free in] the wilderness of Colorado last December.

"You're hungry. I had never thought to be so up close to a wolf."

"She's a very special ambassador."

Kelly Murphy #strike[is]#underline[,] the #underline[animal care] supervisor of Colorado Wolf & Wildlife Center, #strike[who] is one of the advocates helping #strike[wolf reintroduced in] #underline[bring wolves back to] the state.

"#strike[Apparently] #underline[Obviously], it is not an interaction we would have in #underline[the] wild."

"If you see a wolf in the wild, we suggest take pictures and consider yourself lucky as it possibly won't happen #strike[any more] #underline[again]."

There were about 2 million wolves #underline[once] roaming #underline[freely] #strike[in the north] #underline[throughout North] America. But when #strike[the] European #underline[settlers arrived] here, they brought their old myth and hatred of wolf here. Wolves were #underline[nearly] wiped out #strike[in] #underline[by the] 1940s.

"There are a great number of myths and misconceptions #strike[about wolf] #underline[that are surrounding wolves]. Sometimes it's difficult to understand they aren't totally right."

As #strike[the top] #underline[an *apex*] predator of the food chain, they help #strike[to control the population of some animals to help plants, trees and other wildlife grow prosperously.] #underline[keep certain populations in check, which in turn helps plants, trees and other wildlife thrive.]

"They are critical to maintain the balance of the ecosystem, meaning a more productive scenery to the ranchers."

"What did the wolf do to the specific cattle."

"So he #strike[caught the] #underline[got a] hold of her #underline[by] throat and #underline[he got a hold of her by] her hind leg. #strike[She is now better]#underline[It's healed a lot]."

Don Gittleson had #strike[guard] #underline[been *fending off*] the #strike[invasion] #underline[incursions] of wolf #strike[in the ranch of north Colorado] #underline[on his ranch in northern Colorado long] before the initiative.

"There have been wolves for year."

They #strike[came] #underline[have been coming] from the neighbor in Woyoming, #strike[where] #underline[which] reintroduced wolf in the 90s.

"To me, it's my home. To them, it's their home. They #strike[won't leave in this way] #underline[are not just gonna leave]."

"Can you see the tracks #strike[on] #underline[in] the snow?"
"Are those tracks of wolves?"
"#strike[They are tracks they went through last time.] #underline[That's the last time they came through]."

In Colorado, #strike[the initiative of the wolf reintroduction can only get most approval in] #underline[the wolf reintroduction proposition barely passed with most of the votes in favor of reintroduction coming from] urban #strike[region] #underline[areas] like Denver and Baltimore.

"People have strong opinions about wolves. And #strike[whatever the] #underline[it doesn't matter what] side they are on."

But here in the rural #strike[region of Colorado State] #underline[Colorado], #strike[their side are deterministic] #underline[there's no confusing which side they're on]. The state government compensates #strike[for the ranchers whose ... were attacked.] #underline[ranchers for livestock attacks.] But it's illegal to hunt wolves in Colorado, Don has to be creative, using donkeys("They bite hard."), longhorns and shooting the blanks. As for #strike[the] fencing?

"#strike[Put a fence in such a large place?] #underline[It's a pretty big place to put a fence around.]"

“Yep, a foot chain link fence to keep the wolves out. I have moose. I have mule deer. I have elk and I have antelope that cross this country to migrate back and forth. And I would absolutely stop them from doing that. And I am not willing to do that.“

"You care about the #strike[earth] #underline[landscape]."

"So you can't just manage one specie #underline[at a time]."

We don't #strike[want ranchers to] #underline[wanna just leave it to the ranchers to] deal with these problems on their own. Many organizations and NGOs are willing to help #strike[take] #underline[implement] those non-lethal measures. Because #underline[at the end of the day], ranchers and wolf advocates deep down all want the same thing, clean air, clean space, healthy environment and ecosystem. I think wolf is one of the key points #underline[into making that happen].
