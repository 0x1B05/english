== Fast-Food Workers Pay Raise

We start by taking #strike[news in] #underline[you out to] California, where many fast food workers just got a pay #underline[*raise*]#strike[, that] #underline[That's] because of the new law that #strike[when it is to affect] #underline[*went into effect*] on Monday #strike[when they] #underline[, one that] requires all fast food restaurants to pay their employees at least 20 dollars per hour. There are more half #strike[the] #underline[a] million fast food workers in California and many of them are#underline[n't] teenagers working in a#underline[n] after-school job. There are #underline[adults] , looking #underline[to keep a roof] over their heads, and food on their tables. And just this week, many of them just got 25% pay #strike[bomb] #underline[*bump*]. But not everyone is ready to order a happy meal after hearing this news. Many of these chain restaurants #strike[do not own] #underline[they're not owned] by the #underline[larger corporation,] they are owned by #underline[*franchisees*]. So they are more like small businesses, and #underline[these franchise store] owners, they are worried that the #strike[increasing] #underline[increase in] pay would make it too expensive to run their business, meaning they will have to *lay some people off* or stop plans to open new stores or even close some of their existing stores. But some researchers are questioning those fear around pay increases. They *state* over the past decade, California doubled its minimal #underline[*wage*], ending up at the current 16 dollars per hour. And during that time, the data shows that the #strike[increasing] #underline[increase in] pay did not lead to a lot of #strike[layout] #underline[*layoffs*] or #strike[slow down] #underline[a *slowdown*] in the pace of hiring. However, companies like Jack in the Box Starbucks, McDonald's and Chipotle say, they're going to raise prices in the State that already one of the most expensive places to live in the country.

大家好，让我们在这美好的星期二里精神饱满地开始一天，向所有辛勤工作、传授知识、激励我们的老师们致以崇高的敬意。所以一定要跟你的老师握手、击掌、拳头碰一下，让他们知道“我看到你了”。我是科伊，这里是CNN10，最精彩的10分钟新闻。振作起来吧！

首先，我们来到了加利福尼亚，那里的许多快餐工人刚刚获得了加薪。这是因为周一生效的新法律要求所有快餐店至少支付员工每小时20美元的工资。加利福尼亚有超过50万的快餐工人，其中许多并不是青少年在课后打工。他们是成年人，努力维持家庭生计(有家住，有饭吃)。而就在这一周，许多人的工资刚刚涨了25%。但并非每个人都因这个消息而感到开心。许多连锁餐厅并非由大公司所有，而是由加盟店经营。因此，它们更像是小型企业，而这些加盟店的业主们担心工资增加会使经营成本过高，意味着他们可能不得不裁员、取消开设新店的计划，甚至关闭一些现有店铺。但一些研究人员质疑了关于工资增加的这些担忧。他们指出，在过去的十年里，加利福尼亚的最低工资翻了一番，最终达到了当前的每小时16美元。而在此期间，数据显示，工资增加并没有导致大量裁员或招聘速度放缓。然而，像杰克快餐、星巴克、麦当劳和Chipotle这样的公司表示，它们将在这个已经是全美生活成本最高的州提高价格。

#strike[First let's come] #underline[We start by taking you out] to California, where many Fast-Food workers just got a pay raise, for the new law going into effect on Monday requires all the Fast-Food restaurants #strike[must] #underline[to] pay the workers at least 20 dollars per hour.

== Patapsco River Francis Scott Key Bridge

All right, next we take you out onto the Patapsco River to see the #underline[*remnants*] of Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore. As you may remember, last Tuesday in the early morning hour#underline[s], #strike[the ferry] #underline[a *freight*] ship crashed into a *pillar* of the *famed* bridge, causing it to collapse. Official#underline[s] said that the group of the six men#strike[, walking in over nine shift, fixing ... holes] #underline[working an overnight *shift* fixing potholes], died when it collapsed. Gloria Pazmino has more on what's next for the city of Baltimore:

So you can see we have #strike[everybody] #underline[been able to get] extremely up close to the #underline[*wreckage*] of the Dali and #underline[we're starting to really get an] appreciation #strike[on the]#underline[and a] sense of just how massive this job is going to be. You're looking at 4,000 tons of steel and concrete that are #underline[sitting] on top of that #underline[bow.] That is going to be the most complicated part of this operation, moving all of that debris and taking it #strike[on] #underline[off] the ship so they can begin this cleanup process. And then #underline[there's] everything that #strike[lean] #underline[laying] below the #underline[surface,] the part that we can't see, there is more metal, more concrete, more debris #strike[and] #underline[in] the water. And that's going to be critical, because they have to be able to make that safe for the #strike[diverse] #underline[*divers*] whose mission is to get back into the water and continue searching to attempt to recover the bodies of those who were lost. But as we are sitting here, you know now finally being able to see it and get up close to it, you really just get the sense of the #underline[*enormity*] of the job at hand. But all the officials here have told us that they are confident that they #strike[want] #underline[are going] to be able to get it done. They're working #strike[to get their half]#underline[together, have all] of the technology necessary, and they're going step by step, taking #underline[a *meticulous* approach] to make sure that they get #strike[a way] #underline[it right and] that eventually they can #strike[real find the core] #underline[reopen the port], they can start #strike[the way building] #underline[rebuilding], and that is the important symbol for the city of Baltimore. And the city of Baltimore and the Sate of Maryland can get cleaned up. And people here can start getting back to normal. I'm Gloria Pazmino, CNN.

好的，接下来我们带你到Baltimore的Patapsco河上，看看Francis Scott Key Bridge的残骸。你可能还记得，就在上周二清晨，一艘货船撞上了这座著名桥梁的桥墩，导致其倒塌。官员们表示，在倒塌时有六名夜班修补坑洞的工人死亡。Gloria Pazmino会给大家带来更多关于Baltimore市接下来的计划：

你可以看到我们已经能够非常近距离地接触Dali的残骸，我们开始真正意识到这项工作将会有多庞大。你们看到的是4000吨的钢铁和混凝土压在船头上。这将是整个行动中最复杂的部分，清理所有的残骸并将其从船上取下，以便他们开始清理工作。然后还有潜藏在水下的所有东西，那些我们看不见的部分，水中还有更多的金属、混凝土和碎片。这一点至关重要，因为他们必须确保这对于潜水员是安全的，他们的任务是重新进入水中并继续搜索，试图找回那些失踪者的尸体。但是当我们坐在这里，现在终于能够看到并接近它时，你真的能感受到手头工作的巨大。但是这里的所有官员都告诉我们，他们有信心能够完成这项任务。他们正在共同努力，拥有所有必要的技术，他们正在逐步进行，采取一种细致入微的方法，确保他们做对了，并最终可以重新开放港口，开始重建，这对Baltimore市来说是重要的象征。Baltimore市和Maryland州可以得到清理。这里的人们可以开始恢复正常生活。我是Gloria Pazmino，CNN报道。
