== Fast-Food Workers Pay Raise

We start by taking #strike[news in] #underline[you out to] California, where many fast food workers just got a pay #underline[*raise*]#strike[, that] #underline[That's] because of the new law that #strike[when it is to affect] #underline[*went into effect*] on Monday #strike[when they] #underline[, one that] requires all fast food restaurants to pay their employees at least 20 dollars per hour. There are more half #strike[the] #underline[a] million fast food workers in California and many of them are#underline[n't] teenagers working in a#underline[n] after-school job. There are #underline[adults] , looking #underline[to keep a roof] over their heads, and food on their tables. And just this week, many of them just got 25% pay #strike[bomb] #underline[*bump*]. But not everyone is ready to order a happy meal after hearing this news. Many of these chain restaurants #strike[do not own] #underline[they're not owned] by the #underline[larger corporation,] they are owned by #underline[*franchisees*]. So they are more like small businesses, and #underline[these franchise store] owners, they are worried that the #strike[increasing] #underline[increase in] pay would make it too expensive to run their business, meaning they will have to *lay some people off* or stop plans to open new stores or even close some of their existing stores. But some researchers are questioning those fear around pay increases. They *state* over the past decade, California doubled its minimal #underline[*wage*], ending up at the current 16 dollars per hour. And during that time, the data shows that the #strike[increasing] #underline[increase in] pay did not lead to a lot of #strike[layout] #underline[*layoffs*] or #strike[slow down] #underline[a *slowdown*] in the pace of hiring. However, companies like Jack in the Box Starbucks, McDonald's and Chipotle say, they're going to raise prices in the State that already one of the most expensive places to live in the country.

大家好，让我们在这美好的星期二里精神饱满地开始一天，向所有辛勤工作、传授知识、激励我们的老师们致以崇高的敬意。所以一定要跟你的老师握手、击掌、拳头碰一下，让他们知道“我看到你了”。我是科伊，这里是CNN10，最精彩的10分钟新闻。振作起来吧！

首先，我们来到了加利福尼亚，那里的许多快餐工人刚刚获得了加薪。这是因为周一生效的新法律要求所有快餐店至少支付员工每小时20美元的工资。加利福尼亚有超过50万的快餐工人，其中许多并不是青少年在课后打工。他们是成年人，努力维持家庭生计(有家住，有饭吃)。而就在这一周，许多人的工资刚刚涨了25%。但并非每个人都因这个消息而感到开心。许多连锁餐厅并非由大公司所有，而是由加盟店经营。因此，它们更像是小型企业，而这些加盟店的业主们担心工资增加会使经营成本过高，意味着他们可能不得不裁员、取消开设新店的计划，甚至关闭一些现有店铺。但一些研究人员质疑了关于工资增加的这些担忧。他们指出，在过去的十年里，加利福尼亚的最低工资翻了一番，最终达到了当前的每小时16美元。而在此期间，数据显示，工资增加并没有导致大量裁员或招聘速度放缓。然而，像杰克快餐、星巴克、麦当劳和Chipotle这样的公司表示，它们将在这个已经是全美生活成本最高的州提高价格。

#strike[First let's come] #underline[We start by taking you out] to California, where many Fast-Food workers just got a pay raise, for the new law going into effect on Monday requires all the Fast-Food restaurants #strike[must] #underline[to] pay the workers at least 20 dollars per hour. There are more than half a million Fast-Food workers in California, and most of them are not teenagers #strike[doing after-school work] #underline[working in an after-school job]. They are adults, #strike[who tried to have] #underline[looking to keep] a roof over their heads and food on their tables.

Many #strike[franchisees] #underline[of this chain restaurants] are not owned by #strike[a big company] #underline[the larger corporation] but a #strike[franchise] #underline[*franchisees*].
